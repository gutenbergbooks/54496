<p class="chaptitle">ON SPECIAL DUTY.</p>


<p>There was a sudden stir in the forward section
of the stuffy, crowded railway coach.</p>

<p>The interruption to the stolid apathy that had
crept over the passengers, for the dust and heat
had made them drowsy, came in the form of
voices raised in anger and indignant protest.</p>

<p>The racket proceeded from a cross-seat occupied
by two young fellows. One of them was
a youth of about eighteen with hair of a violent
ruddy hue. His seat-mate was, perhaps, a trifle
older, heavy set, rather sallow, with close-cropped
black hair. Both were sunburned and
bore, somehow, the unmistakable look of those
who follow the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here, you, what have you got your hand
in my pocket for, hey?"</p>

<p>Thus the red-haired lad, before whom reposed
a leather suit-case bearing the name,&mdash;neatly
stenciled on one end,&mdash;"H. Taylor, U.S.N."</p>

<p>"I've lost my wallet," came the rejoinder in
angry, high-pitched tones. "It had most of my
pay in it, too."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter with looking in your
own pocket?" sputtered Herc Taylor indignantly.</p>

<p>"I did, but I can't find it."</p>

<p>"So you assume that I'm the thief, do you?"</p>

<p>This was certainly a conversation to attract
attention. Both speakers appeared to be in highly
belligerent moods. Several of the passengers
seated in the vicinity of the excitement began to
rise in their seats and crane their necks, the better
to behold the "scrap" that appeared imminent.</p>

<p>But those nearest to the pair saw that Herc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Taylor's large, freckled fist had closed on the
wrist of the other's investigating hand, so that,
for the present at any rate, the latter was not
able to attempt retaliation except verbally.</p>

<p>Herc was neatly but quietly dressed in a gray-mixture
suit. His seat-mate, the one who had
made the ugly accusation, wore clothes that appeared
to have been rather neglected recently.
They were crumpled and stained and the whole
air of the fellow, despite his healthy-looking tan,
was slouchy and shiftless.</p>

<p>Herc glared straight into the other's eyes for
possibly the space of a minute or so. Before
his direct glance the slouchy-looking youth's eyes
fell.</p>

<p>"Aw, leggo my hand, will yer?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's no pleasure to me to hold it," rejoined
Herc, relaxing his grip. Where he had
held the other, a white bracelet of skin appeared,
showing that Herc possessed a mighty set of
muscles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd advise you to keep your hand where it
belongs in the future," added Herc.</p>

<p>A third young fellow, who had been seated
behind the quarreling pair, leaned forward. He
had been reading a naval-service periodical. But
now his attention was distracted, and he tapped
the red-headed youth on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"What appears to be the trouble, Herc?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, Ned," rejoined the younger
of the Dreadnought Boys, turning to his cousin,
Ned Strong. "This fellow just suffered from
a severe case of wandering hand, that's all."</p>

<p>A smile came over Ned Strong's clean-cut,
bronzed features. His blue eyes twinkled as he
directed a glance to the floor of the section in
front of him.</p>

<p>"What's that lying on the floor right there by
your feet, my friend?" he asked of Herc's seat-mate.</p>

<p>"Gosh! if it isn't my wallet!" exclaimed the
stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>He stooped and picked it up, looking rather
sheepish and foolish as he encountered Ned's
smile.</p>

<p>"You see, it isn't a good plan to go up in the
air before you make quite sure you won't have
to come down again with a hard bump," said
the Dreadnought Boy quietly, but with a good-natured
intonation.</p>

<p>"Aw, stow that," growled the other. "I didn't
do no harm."</p>

<p>"No, but if I hadn't been a young person of
marked coolness and restraint, I might have done
<i>you</i> some," grinned Herc.</p>

<p>Here the incident appeared to be terminated
for the time being. Soon after, the disgruntled
neighbor of Herc Taylor arose and sought a
seat in another part of the car. The smiling
looks of the passengers in the vicinity of the little
ruction had proved too much for his sensibilities.</p>

<p>As he rose from his seat, he carried with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
his suit-case. After he was beyond ear-shot, Ned
turned to Herc.</p>

<p>"That fellow may be one of our shipmates,"
he said in low tones.</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"I saw the name 'Dilworth Rankin' and the
letters 'U.S.N.' after it," was Ned's rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I'm much impressed with what
I've seen of young Mr. Rankin," retorted Herc,
carelessly. "At any rate we are under special
commissions now, so that if he gets gay or anything
like that, I'll have him put in the brig in
short order. I always said, after I had that little
session of mine in the brig, that if I ever got a
chance I'd see how it felt to slap somebody else
in there; and if he gets fresh it might just as well
be Rankin as anyone else."</p>

<p>"You'll do no such thing," retorted Ned seriously.
"Just because we're holding little temporary
commissions as junior officers, you can't
show off your authority like that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! what's the use of being officers, then?"</p>

<p>"To teach us something. To get some new
ideas and experiences into that red head of
yours."</p>

<p>"See here, now that I'm an officer, I'll thank
you to refer to my locks as auburn," muttered
Herc. "I'll feel like using my new sword on
anybody who calls attention to the color of my
sky-piece hereafter."</p>

<p>"All right," laughed Ned, "I'll call it any color
you like. But, hullo! there's blue water. We
must be getting near to Miller's Haven. I wonder
if the <i>Seneca</i> has arrived yet?"</p>

<p>"Hope so," rejoined Herc. "I want to be boss
just as quickly and just as long as possible. I
wish some of the old boys on the <i>Manhattan</i>
could see us when we start out to sea. Have you
opened your orders yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. As you know, they are sealed and
not to be opened till we have coaled and proceeded
to sea. The first thing we must do when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
we reach Miller's Haven is to report to Ensign
Summerville, at present in command of the
<i>Seneca</i>, and hand him his orders."</p>

<p>"His walking papers," interpolated Herc. "I
wonder if we'll get orders to join the Red fleet
right off?"</p>

<p>"That's impossible to say," replied Ned. "As
I understand it, we are to do duty as a scout
cruiser, depending largely on our wireless for
keeping in touch with the Red fleet and informing
them of every move of the Blues."</p>

<p>"Then we may not be with the fleet at all?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. But I guess our work as
scouts will keep us so busy that we won't notice
the lack of company."</p>

<p>"I'd rather be back with the fleet," muttered
Herc.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," rejoined Ned, his eyes flashing
and his cheeks flushing under the tan. "Why,
Herc, boy, we've got the biggest chance of our
lives! To my mind this detail to which we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
been assigned will prove the most interesting
work we have ever tackled."</p>

<p>"Miller's Haven!"</p>

<p>The voices of the trainmen rang raucously
through the car. The boys arose and made their
way to the forward door. As Ned had surmised,
they were indeed on the threshold of some of the
most interesting experiences they had ever encountered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">RED VS. BLUE.</p>


<p>Within the last week the Dreadnought Boys
had taken their first big step upward. They entered
Miller's Haven with their commissions on
new, crackly parchment, tucked over a pair of as
proud and happy hearts as there were in the
navy.</p>

<p>Great had been their surprise, when, some four
days before we encountered them on the train
for Miller's Haven, their commander, Captain
Dunham, of the Dreadnought <i>Manhattan</i>, had
sent for them. Both lads, as readers of other
volumes of this series know, had already gained
high non-commissioned ratings.</p>

<p>Captain Dunham's unexpected summons had
come on the eve of the long-looked-for "siege" of
New York harbor. The Red fleet to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<i>Manhattan</i> had been commissioned as flagship,
was to have the task of attacking the harbor at
the gates of Long Island Sound. The Blue
squadron was to have the defense of the port.
Final arrangements for the biggest naval war
game of its kind ever attempted had been made,
with an attention to detail and probable actual
conditions of a sea attack on the harbor which
was little short of marvelous.</p>

<p>With wireless, big guns, Argand signals, torpedoes
and submarines every effort was to be
made to duplicate as perfectly as possible conditions
of a real attack. The newspapers had been
carrying columns of copy concerning the big war
game, and public interest was wrought to its
highest pitch.</p>

<p>But it was in the navy itself that enthusiasm
ran the highest. Strategists from all over the
world were to be present, and elaborate precautions
had been taken to insure Uncle Sam's carefully
guarded naval secrets from leaking out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
In this connection, what practically amounted to
a Secret Service had been established, both on
board the great sea-fighters of the two squadrons
and also at the twin forts, Totten and Schuyler,
which guard the Sound entrance to the East
River and the port of New York.</p>

<p>Such, as has been said, was the interesting eve
of "hostilities" which prevailed, when to Ned
and Herc came the orders to report aft in the
commander's quarters at once.</p>

<p>The <i>Manhattan</i> lay in the Brooklyn navy yard
being groomed, like a thoroughbred on the eve
of a great race, for the important part she was
to play as the flagship of the Red fleet. Jackies,
every one of them with an alert and keen pride
in his work, were dismantling and fitting the
big craft till everything about her grim, slate-colored
hull was attuned to the condition in
which she would be placed were she actually answering
a summons to defend the Empire City
from the invasion of a foreign foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Dunham sat in his cabin in the midst
of a great pile of documents of all kinds. The
pictures and other objects usually to be found
adorning the commander's comfortable quarters
were missing. The cabin had been stripped and
everything breakable packed away, just as would
have been the case had the <i>Manhattan</i> been going
to steam out and engage an actual foe. This had
been done so that the earthquake-like shock and
tremble of the mighty broadsides,&mdash;the grim
fangs of this sea bulldog,&mdash;might not work havoc
with breakable things.</p>

<p>The two young non-commissioned officers were
passed by the orderly and then stood smartly at
attention, trim heels together, bright eyes looking
straight in front of them till the commander
looked up from some departmental papers he was
perusing.</p>

<p>During this interval they had time to notice
that a tall, slender, alertly-built man, with threads
of gray in his dark hair, was seated near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
commander. He eyed the boys interestedly with
the critical air of a man who is in the habit of
making swift appraisal of those with whom he
comes in contact.</p>

<p>His keen gray eyes swept the two well-built,
clean-cut and reliable-looking young sailors with
a look that appeared to spell approval. As a
matter of fact, the assistant secretary of the
navy, for such was the office of Commander
Dunham's companion, was deeply interested in
his inspection of the two lads of whom he had
heard much.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that not long after they entered
the service of Uncle Sam and deeded their
lives to the flag, Ned and Herc had had an opportunity
to distinguish themselves.</p>

<p>How they foiled a desperate plot against the
navy, then assembled in Guantanamo Bay in
Cuba, at the naval base established there, and
also their conspicuous bravery in the panic that
followed a disastrous "flare-back" in a thirteen-inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
turret, were told, with many other of their
adventures, in the first volume of this series,
"The Dreadnought Boys on Battle Practice."</p>

<p>In the next book, devoted to describing the lives
of the spruce young jack-tars of to-day on board
the big, drab sea-fighters, we followed the lads
through a long siege of mystery and intrigue,
intermingled with plenty of stern fighting. This
book was called "The Dreadnought Boys Aboard
a Destroyer."</p>

<p>Grim as the name of "destroyer" that she
bore was the <i>Beale</i>; and when she was despatched
to South America with the duty of straightening
out a peculiar international tangle confronting
her commander, the boys were detailed to duty
on board her. In the midst of a revolution, involving
the lives and property of American citizens,
they played their parts right well, and by
a display of clever strategy turned a defeat,
which had seemed imminent to the interests amicable
to the Americans, into a brilliant victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Readers of that volume will not soon forget the
defense of the hill, with the battery of machine
guns breathing flame and destruction from their
iron throats.</p>

<p>"The Dreadnought Boys on a Submarine"
showed an intimate picture of naval life on a
diving torpedo boat. In realistic detail all that
befell the lads on the surface and in the depths
of old ocean was related, and their many adventures
were faithfully set forth. As in previous
chapters of their lives, the boys were not
found wanting when perils and dangers called
for quick, decisive action and cool, alert minds.
In the submarine service they added new laurels
to their already growing fame, and moved up
more steps on the long ladder of promotion.</p>

<p>When the navy department began its experiments
with aeroplanes as important auxiliaries
to modern battleships, Ned and Herc were among
the first in the fleet to volunteer, although such
service involved the signing of a grim paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
which absolved the government of all responsibility
for the naval aviator's life. As might be
expected, the lads found things by no means
tame in the aero squad. Ned's great feat of
landing on a battleship,&mdash;a common enough
maneuver now,&mdash;was long talked of in the fleet
after the boy had successfully made the first attempt
in the history of the world to accomplish
such a thing.</p>

<p>Naturally, too, the boys who had worked so
ambitiously for name and fame had made enemies
among small-minded and envious men.
These foes made things exciting for the lads for
a time; but in the end both Ned and Herc righted
themselves and were vindicated from a severe
charge which had resulted from the machinations
of those who disliked them. This book, which
was called "The Dreadnought Boys on Aero
Service," teemed with incident and shifting
scenes. Much attention was paid to the manipulation
and flying of modern aeroplanes, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
book was instructive as well as interesting.</p>

<p>The famous "Round the World Cruise of the
American Navy," a voyage that will go down
in history as one of the most effective demonstrations
of sea power ever made, formed the theme
of the succeeding volume, which was "The
Dreadnought Boys' World Cruise." As petty
officers of the first rank, Ned and Herc found
many opportunities to distinguish themselves.
Jack ashore is sometimes a difficult proposition
to handle, and Ned, as a non-commissioned officer,
had much responsibility to shoulder. In
carrying out his duties he incurred the enmity
of some of those he had been obliged to discipline,
and a thrilling adventure in the pyramids
of Egypt was the result.</p>

<p>Then, too, Ned and Herc met with many
other experiences in the various countries the
fleet visited, including a laughable predicament
on the Rock of Gibraltar, when, through the stupidity
of an over-officious British army sergeant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
they were compelled to spend some hours in a
dungeon excavated in the rock. Herc solved the
problem of escape and unlocked the dungeon
doors by means of wig-wagged signals to the
fleet, lying at anchor below the rock.</p>

<p>And now you are better acquainted with Ned
Strong and Herc Taylor, and can understand,
by perusal of the preceding long but necessary
digression, just why it was that they were admired
and loved by their shipmates and respected
by their officers; and why, too, Captain Dunham
should have singled them out for the duty to
which he was about to assign them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"ARE WE AWAKE?"</p>


<p>The commander of the <i>Manhattan</i>, an imposing,
bronzed figure of a man, and a thorough
sailor, swung around in his chair and faced the
two young Jackies he had summoned.</p>

<p>"These are the lads I was speaking to you
about, Mr. Secretary," he said, addressing his
companion.</p>

<p>The lads drew themselves up and saluted, not
without a quickened action of their hearts. They
guessed at once from the manner in which he
had been addressed, that the stranger was one
of the "big-wigs" of the naval department. Herc
turned as red as his thatch, and the freckles
stood out on his round and jolly countenance like
the famous spots on the sun.</p>

<p>Ned retained his self-possession better, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
reality he was quite as excited as was his shipmate
and chum. Eagerly he waited for words
which might offer a key to the meaning of this
unusual summons.</p>

<p>They were not long in coming. The Secretary
nodded his head and looked approvingly at the
boys.</p>

<p>"They quite measure up, sir, to all that I have
heard of them," he said. "And now," with a
kindly smile at the two embarrassed lads, "I
don't think we need keep them in suspense any
longer."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," rejoined the captain.
"Lads, I have sent for you to confer upon you,
at the request of the Secretary of the Navy, a
most unusual honor. I know you will appreciate
it as it merits."</p>

<p>The boys did not utter, in words, a reply. It
would not have been proper for them to have
made any comments or to have spoken, except
in answer to direct orders or to questions. The
commander continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your careers in the navy have been marked
by more than ordinary devotion to duty and by
frequent exhibitions of ability that have made
you both appear to be worthy of still higher promotion
than you have yet achieved. I think that
you both possess executive ability, and the Secretary
and myself have decided to assign you to
roles in the coming war game that will give you
ample opportunity to show of what sort of stuff
you are made."</p>

<p>The boys, with burning faces, drew themselves
up and saluted. But within their breasts was a
wild tumult despite their calm exteriors. What
could be coming?</p>

<p>"And now for what you are to do. You are to
proceed to Miller's Haven on the Connecticut
shore and there join the gunboat <i>Seneca</i>. You
will convoy two submarines for use in scout work
against the Blue fleet, which, of course, you
know, is opposed to us and is defending the harbor
of New York. You understand?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Y-y-yes, sir," rejoined Ned; while Herc, so
taken by surprise that he was deprived of articulate
speech, merely mumbled something.</p>

<p>"To whom are we to report, sir?" ventured
Ned.</p>

<p>Commander Dunham smiled and exchanged
glances with the departmental visitor.</p>

<p>"You will report to yourselves. That is, you
will be in command of the <i>Seneca</i>."</p>

<p>Even Ned's sense of discipline deserted him at
this announcement.</p>

<p>"In&mdash;in command? I&mdash;I'm afraid, sir, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said in command. Practically every commissioned
officer in the service will be on other
and more important duties. We have, therefore,
secured for you temporary commissions, enduring,
of course, only during your period of attachment
to the <i>Seneca</i>. She is a small boat of
not very modern design, but I shall expect to see
you perform some important work with her. She
is equipped with wireless, of course, and the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
that both of you understand wireless and the
naval code has been another inducement to give
you this big chance. You will each get a copy of
the special code to be used in the war game when
you join the ship."</p>

<p>"Then we&mdash;we are officers?" stuttered Herc,
unable to keep silent any longer. As for Ned,
outwardly cool and collected, his glowing eyes
showed what he thought.</p>

<p>"Officers temporarily," was the reply. "Here
are your commissions."</p>

<p>From his desk Commander Dunham took the
two documents which to the Dreadnought Boys
appeared the most wonderful things they had
ever set eyes on.</p>

<p>Handing one to Ned, the commander then
spoke some words that sent the boy soaring up
into the seventh heaven of delight.</p>

<p>"This confers on you, Strong, the rank, pay
and authority of a lieutenant, junior grade, in
the United States Navy. Taylor, your commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
confers upon you the special rank of ensign.</p>

<p>"That is all. Your uniforms will be secured
from the yard tailor. Your instructions are in
this sealed package. You are not to open them
till you have cleared. From time to time you
will get other instructions by wireless, couched
in the terms of the secret code adopted by the
Red fleet. Your duty, in a nutshell, will be to
be the eyes of the Red squadron. Carry on!"</p>

<p>With this crisp expression of dismissal, the
commander turned to his table again. The lads
saluted, and marched out of the cabin.</p>

<p>They appeared to be traversing fleecy clouds
of wonderful brightness as they made their way
forward.</p>

<p>"Hello, Red-head," hailed a gunner's mate as
Herc strutted with all the pride of a peacock to
the forward part of the ship, "what's biting you?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me like that, Jenks," returned
Herc with some hauteur. "I'm an officer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"A what?" roared Jenks. "Say, turn over.
You're on your back. You haven't been working
hard enough lately, Brick-top, and you're talking
in your sleep."</p>

<p>"Wonderful as it all seems, though, Jenks, it's
true," said Ned, with dancing eyes. "But I can't
realize yet that I'm not asleep and dreaming the
greatest dream a fellow could ever have."</p>

<p>Jenks stared for a minute and then clasped
Ned's hand.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad, shipmate," said he. "You
had it coming to you."</p>

<p>"But it isn't going to last," said Herc plaintively.
"It will only hold out as long as the war
game, and then we'll be back in the ranks&mdash;that
is, if we don't fall out of bed first."</p>

<p>Ned said nothing, but he gazed with absent
eyes over the busy scene,&mdash;the swarming river
and the great yard with its life and movement
and busy note of preparation. He was indulging
in the most delicious reverie he had ever experienced.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HERC "MIXES IN."</p>


<p>Miller's Haven was a small place on the Sound
shore, several miles up. It boasted a bay full
of shoals and tricky channels and a group of
islands lying in a cluster near the mouth of this
bay.</p>

<p>Ned knew from his previous instructions that
the <i>Seneca</i> would be lying in the shelter of one
of these islands, as securely moored to avoid observation
from the scouts of the Blue squadron
as was possible. Miller's Haven was a sleepy
spot,&mdash;little more than a fishing village, in
truth,&mdash;and nobody in the place was likely to pay
much attention to the fact that a small gunboat,
looking more like a yacht than a vessel of
the navy, lay, with every appearance of secrecy,
off their hamlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, the <i>Seneca</i> had been used in several
capacities. Her latest work, before being told
off as a scout and despatch craft, was with the
Revenue Service.</p>

<p>In this capacity the <i>Seneca</i> had been deemed
worthy of refitting so far as boilers and engines
were concerned, so that, although she was not
large, she was swift and powerful and just the
craft for the work in which she was to be employed
during the maneuvers. Her speed had
been shown in several chases after motor-boat
smugglers, in most cases she having easily overhauled
even the fastest of these wasp-like violators
of Uncle Sam's customs regulations.</p>

<p>"We'll go to the hotel first," decided Ned as
they stood on the wind-swept platform at Miller's
Haven.</p>

<p>Out on the Sound the blue water was flecked
with white and a brisk wind, salt-laden and delightful
to the boys' sea-going nostrils, had left
the sky clear and cloudless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're going to meet Ensign Summerville
there?" asked Herc.</p>

<p>"Yes, he'll come ashore with a boat and take
us out and introduce us to our first command."</p>

<p>"Huh! it may be our last, too," grunted Herc.
"Say, this thing of being a real, full-fledged officer
scares me just a little. Suppose we fall
down?"</p>

<p>"We can only attend to our duty the best we
know how," rejoined Ned. "If we can carry out
the work cut out for us in good shape, it will
mean that we'll go a few more rungs up the
ladder."</p>

<p>"Yes, if nobody pulls the ladder down," mumbled
Herc pessimistically.</p>

<p>The two trim, trig lads, in their quiet, unassuming
clothes, attracted little or no attention on
the single street that Miller's Haven boasted.
True, one or two passers-by looked rather curiously
at the yellow leather sword cases that they
carried, but that was all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>The hotel soon came in sight, a dingy-looking
structure sadly in need of paint. A dejected-looking
citizen with a drooping mustache, a
drooping manner, drooping gray garments and
a drooping way of draping himself in his chair,
occupied the porch.</p>

<p>"Doesn't look like much of a place," commented
Ned, "but we can get a room here that
will be good enough to change in, I dare say."</p>

<p>"A room!" demanded Herc. "What do you
want a room for? I thought we were going to
eat."</p>

<p>"No, we will change into our uniforms first.
It would not be the correct thing to board our
new command in ordinary clothes. I should
think you'd know that."</p>

<p>"Have we got to wear our swords?" inquired
Herc with a rebellious look.</p>

<p>"Don't you know enough of navy usages yet
to be aware that officers must wear their swords
under certain conditions, such as taking command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of a new craft and other ceremonial occasions?"</p>

<p>"Umph! Well, all I hope is I don't tumble over
that cheese toaster of mine."</p>

<p>"If you do anything like that, I'll disown you
for a brother officer of mine," laughed Ned.
"But, seriously, Herc, I want you to be on your
best behavior and not make any bad breaks."</p>

<p>"Huh! Just as if you were any more used to
carrying a sticker,&mdash;I mean a sword,&mdash;than I
am! I'll be all right. Don't you worry about
me, Mister Lieutenant. I bet I will be just as
good an officer as there is in the navy."</p>

<p>"We'll wait and see&mdash;&mdash;" began Ned good-naturedly,
when Herc cut him short with an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Look who's here! Right behind us!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked Ned, for he was half-way
up the steps by this time and the drooping
eyes of the landlord, as Ned had rightly conjectured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that the dejected man was, were regarding
him with languid interest.</p>

<p>"It's that Rankin fellow! He's looking at us
disrespectfully. I've a good mind to tell him
that we are officers!"</p>

<p>"You'll do no such thing. If he has been detailed
to the <i>Seneca</i>, which I think probable, he'll
find out our rank for himself soon enough."</p>

<p>"Just the same, I'd like to make him salute
me," grumbled Herc.</p>

<p>Rankin ascended the steps behind the two
Dreadnought Boys. He was close on their heels,
when suddenly Herc's feet flew up and out behind
him. In his new dignity he had been holding
his head so high that he did not notice a bit
of banana peel lying on the untidy steps of the
Eagle Hotel.</p>

<p>Crash! The newly created officer performed
an almost complete back somersault with great
effect. Plump! came down his not over-light
form right on top of the ascending Rankin. Together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
they rolled down the steps and into the
dusty road, while Ned looked on in dismay.</p>

<p>"You done that a-purpose! I'll fix you for
it!" bellowed Rankin furiously.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, you numbskull?"
retaliated Herc, as the two rolled on the dusty
street. "Don't be a fool! Let me up."</p>

<p>But Rankin clung tightly to Herc, for whom
he had conceived an intense dislike ever since the
episode on the train.</p>

<p>"You try to make a fool out of me, will you?"
he growled; and as they clinched and tumbled
about at the foot of the steps, Rankin aimed a
vicious blow at Herc, who returned it with right
good will.</p>

<p>"Gracious! Here's a fine kettle of fish!" exclaimed
Ned in consternation.</p>

<p>He started back down the steps at top speed,
determined to stop such a scene at all costs. It
was really too bad that their arrival in Miller's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Haven should be marked by such a disgraceful
mix-up.</p>

<p>Ned glanced anxiously down the street and
was glad to see that no one was in sight. He
would not, for the world, have had anyone witness
the mêlée who was in any way connected
with the navy.</p>

<p>"Get up at once, Herc!" he cried, thoroughly
angry. "Stop it instantly. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>But despite Ned's admonitions, the pair on the
ground continued their struggle, the noise of
their thumps and pantings rising above Ned's
voice. Flushed with vexation and indignation
at Herc, Ned determined to take decisive action.</p>

<p>He cleared the last two steps of the flight leading
to the street in one jump. The next instant
his hands shot out.</p>

<p>"Stop this and stop it quick!" he ejaculated.
"What sort of a way do you consider this to behave?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">OFF TO THEIR FIRST COMMAND.</p>


<p>Herc felt a strong hand on his collar. The
next second he was yanked to his feet "all standing."
Flushed, dust-covered and indignant he
began a fusillade of irritated speech.</p>

<p>But Ned cut short the flow with a peremptory
gesture.</p>

<p>"That's quite enough. Come inside at once."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At once, I said; march!"</p>

<p>Herc knew it was no use to disobey, and with
a backward look at Rankin, he sulkily climbed
up the steps. Rankin picked himself up out of
the dust. He appeared to be about to say something,
but before he could find words, the two
Dreadnought Boys were through the door of the
hotel and inside the small office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The drooping man, who had watched the battle
without a shadow of interest or excitement,
betrayed no great change in manner as he came
forward.</p>

<p>"'Kin I do fer yer?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"We want to get a room here. Not for very
long; just for sufficient time in which to change
into our uniforms," explained Ned. "We are expecting
a Mr. Summerville of the United States
Navy to meet us here."</p>

<p>"Be you in the navy?" inquired the drooping
man, allowing himself to betray momentarily a
slight, very slight accession of interest.</p>

<p>"We are. We can get a room, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"You kin, an' if you'll pardon my saying so,
yer pardner sure needs a change."</p>

<p>Herc colored hotly. The hotel man must have
noticed this, for he went on.</p>

<p>"You don't know that feller Rankin, then?"</p>

<p>"We do not," replied Ned shortly.</p>

<p>"'Cause if you did, you'd know he's always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
picking quarrels. He's an 'sistant 'gineer on the
<i>Senecy</i>, which I reckon is the boat yer goin' ter
jine."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe she is anchored off here. But
will you show us to our room right away, please?
We don't wish to keep Mr. Summerville waiting."</p>

<p>The drooping and dejected landlord looked
more dismal than ever as he showed the boys to
a small room. It did not take them long to don
the natty uniforms of junior officers in the United
States Navy. While they changed their attire,
Herc was roundly lectured by Ned for taking
part in the scene in front of the hotel.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it happened," declared Ned; "Rankin
being a petty officer of the <i>Seneca</i>, too, doesn't
make it any the easier."</p>

<p>"I ought to have lambasted him with my new
sword," muttered Herc truculently.</p>

<p>"And made a bad matter worse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see how it would. That fellow needs
a good lesson."</p>

<p>"You'll never teach him one in that way. Besides,
naval officers don't behave in such a fashion.
You must have dignity and self-control."</p>

<p>"Huh! If I'd had foot control instead of self-control,
I wouldn't have tumbled down those
steps, and then nothing would have happened,"
grumbled Herc, tenderly patting a bump on the
top of his head.</p>

<p>"You look like an officer, Ned," he went on a
few moments later, as, pausing in his own preparations,
he gazed at the trim, natty figure of Ned
Strong.</p>

<p>Herc was right. The slender, yet strongly
built lad did indeed look every inch fitted for the
quarter-deck of a naval vessel when, having finished
his other sartorial duties, he buckled on his
sword and adjusted his cap.</p>

<p>"Well, so do you, don't you?" laughed Ned,
watching Herc as, with a face fiery red with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
exertions, his comrade buckled himself into his
tightly fitting uniform.</p>

<p>"Don't know," responded Herc briefly, "I feel
rather more like a tailor's dummy. How do I
look?"</p>

<p>"All right. But cool your face off in that
water. It looks as if you'd been taking a turn
in the fire room."</p>

<p>"Well, so long as I don't do a flop over my
sword, I don't care," rejoined Herc, as he carefully
removed the scabbard of that weapon from
between his knees where it threatened at any moment
to cause disaster.</p>

<p>Not many minutes later they descended from
the room, just in time to be greeted by a stalwart
coxswain.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Strong, sir?" asked the man, coming
to attention just as Ned and Herc had done
so often.</p>

<p>It certainly felt strange to acknowledge the
salute in an official way, not to mention being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
addressed as Lieutenant. Herc was, in fact, compelled
to hide a grin behind his pocket handkerchief.
Luckily, Ned did not see this, or Herc
might have had another lecture.</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Ned, returning the man's salute.
"You are from the <i>Seneca</i>?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir. The gig is waiting to take you
aboard, sir. Ensign Summerville sent his regrets,
sir, and he is too busy attending to matters
wirelessed from the flagship to come ashore himself."</p>

<p>"Very well, we may as well get aboard, then,"
said Ned.</p>

<p>At this moment Rankin emerged from the
hotel. He had evidently been busy removing
traces of battle from his face, for his sallow
countenance shone with soap. To say that he
looked surprised when he saw Ned and Herc
transformed into naval officers of rank much
above his own, would be to put it mildly. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
expressive word "flabbergasted" better describes
the look on Rankin's well-soaped visage.</p>

<p>He was far too well trained in naval usage to
put his astonishment into words, however. Returning
from a furlough, he knew nothing, of
course, of the change in the commanding officers
of the <i>Seneca</i>; but he recognized that Ned, as
his uniform showed, outranked Ensign Summerville,
and from this fact deduced that he must
have come to take command of the little gunboat.</p>

<p>He drew himself up and saluted with naval
conciseness. The boys returned the salute with
perfect gravity. To judge by the countenances
of all three, no bystander would ever have
guessed how it had been with them not so very
long before.</p>

<p>Herc, however, noted, perhaps not without a
certain malicious satisfaction, that over Rankin's
right eye was a plum-colored discoloration which
appeared to be swelling. Once, too, when on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
way to the boat he happened to glance in Rankin's
direction, he surprised a glowering look on
the assistant engineer's face which was instantly
wiped off when Rankin saw that he was being
observed.</p>

<p>"Huh, that was a quick change, like sponging
something off a slate," thought Herc to himself.
"However, Mr. Rankin, I've no idea that
you love your second in command any better than
you ought to. I guess I'll keep my weather eye
on you, for at times you certainly do look most
uncommonly like a rattlesnake."</p>

<p>The coxswain had taken charge of the boys'
suit and sword cases. Rankin carried his own
valise. It did not take them long to reach the
little wharf, alongside which lay the <i>Seneca's</i> gig,
the four men of her crew smoking and lolling at
their ease at her oarlocks.</p>

<p>Like a flash all inertia vanished as Ned and
Herc hove in sight. The coxswain saluted once
more. The men saluted. Ned and Herc saluted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>As the two lads sank into the stern thwart
seat, Herc found opportunity to whisper to Ned,
"Give me a teeny jab with that sword if you
can."</p>

<p>"Why on earth do you want me to do that?"
demanded Ned, in astonishment at Herc's seemingly
perfectly serious request.</p>

<p>With his hand over his mouth Herc gave a
veiled rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Because if it doesn't hurt, I'll know I'm
tucked in my little hammock and dreaming!"</p>

<p>"All ready, sir," suggested the coxswain, taking
his seat.</p>

<p>"Give way," ordered Ned calmly, and the four
oars struck the water like one.</p>

<p>The boys were fairly off on their way to their
first command.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WELCOME TO THE "SENECA."</p>


<p>Swiftly, steadily urged on, like some great
beetle moving across the surface of a sheet of
burnished glass, the gig was impelled over the
smooth expanse of the sheltered waters; for, although
outside in the Sound itself the whitecaps
were prancing under the lee of the islands, here
it was almost a flat calm.</p>

<p>The men rowed in perfect unison, like some
accurately timed piece of mechanism. Before
long they could make out, lying in under the
shoulder of a distant island, the outlines of a
slate-colored craft.</p>

<p>"The <i>Seneca</i>?" asked Ned of the coxswain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that's the <i>Seneca</i>."</p>

<p>"She looks a trim little hooker."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir; she's all of that, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned and Herc gazed with burning eyes and
dancing pulses at the little craft. She was certainly
not very large or imposing, but to them
just then the finest Dreadnought ever launched
could not have brought such emotions.</p>

<p>Not more than two hundred and fifty feet long,
the <i>Seneca</i> appeared at first glance more like the
ideal of a smart yacht than a craft of war. She
had a sharp, overhanging bow and a beautifully
modeled stern. Her rigging was of the schooner
type, with the spider-web outlines of her wireless
aerials slung between them.</p>

<p>In respect, doubtless, of her yachty lines, the
<i>Seneca</i> had been used by a former President as
a sort of official craft to convoy him to maneuvers
and reviews.</p>

<p>Ned felt his enthusiasm rising, too, as lying
against the <i>Seneca's</i> side, like the young of some
sea monster, he made out the porpoise-like backs
of the two submarines of which she was the
parent ship. The sight of them brought back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
him the stirring days when he and Herc had
aided the inventor of that type of diving boat,
both in his pioneer voyages and in his romance.</p>

<p>He had only time to drink in this and other
details with greedy eyes, when the gig swept
around to the starboard gangway, reserved by
immemorial custom for officers' embarkation.</p>

<p>From the marine sentry stationed at the head
of the gangway came a sharp hail.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy! What boat is that?"</p>

<p>"Aye! aye!" came from the coxswain.</p>

<p>This showed that there were commissioned
officers on board. Had they been non-commissioned
passengers, the reply to the hail would
have been: "No! no!" For the captain and
for other higher naval ranks there were other
rejoinders, which have been enumerated in preceding
volumes.</p>

<p>The gig was made fast. With a springy step
and glowing features, Ned stepped out first. He
was followed closely by Herc. A rattling sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and an exclamation behind him, made Ned pause
as he set foot on the gangway platform.</p>

<p>For an instant there was every sign that poor
Herc was going to get into hot water for the
second time that day. That unlucky sword had
become entangled in his long legs, and for a
time he hovered on the brink of disaster. But
the watchful coxswain caught his arm and saved
him the humiliation of tumbling into the water,
new uniform and all.</p>

<p>It was all over in a moment and both boys
hastened up to the head of the gangway. A corporal
and four other marines besides the sentry
now stood there. There was a sharp command
and the sea-soldiers presented arms smartly.</p>

<p>"Goodness, I'll wear out my new cap with
much more of this," thought Herc, as he acknowledged
the salute simultaneously with Ned.</p>

<p>Just then a smart looking young naval officer
behind the marines saluted. This, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
called for another answer. "Lieutenant Strong,
I presume?" inquired this personage.</p>

<p>"Yes. And this is Ensign Taylor."</p>

<p>They shook hands and then the young officer,
who was Ensign Summerville, suggested that
the new arrivals be shown to their quarters.</p>

<p>"You may as well make yourselves at home as
soon as possible," he said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Thanks; you are very kind," rejoined Ned,
speaking for himself and Herc, for the latter
was in a sort of happy daze.</p>

<p>"Then if you will come this way, please."</p>

<p>At a word from the corporal of marines, the
boys' baggage was picked up by two of his men
who preceded the party along the deck and
turned into an alleyway, from which in turn they
descended a companionway into the wardroom
from which the cabins opened.</p>

<p>Up till the actual moment that he beheld his
cabin, Ned still entertained fears that it might
all be a vision which was likely to fade out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
any moment. But the sight of the snug cabin
with its big double ports and broad berth, bookcase,
desk and chairs made him realize that it
was no figment of his imagination.</p>

<p>Knowing men-of-war of all types as well as
he did, the boy appreciated with a throb of delight
that this was no ordinary junior officer's
cabin into which he had been ushered. Its size
and the elaborateness of its fittings precluded
that idea.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, this is a magnificent stateroom,"
he found himself saying.</p>

<p>"It is the room that the commander of this vessel
has always occupied," was the smiling rejoinder.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ned Strong gave one of his winning
laughs in return.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. Summerville," said he,
"I can hardly wake up to the fact that I am to
command this fine little craft."</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly are, for the purposes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
this war game, anyhow. They've got a notion
that I'm rather a dab at strategic navigation, so
they've passed me on to the Washington cruiser.
Let me congratulate you on the command of a
fine little craft."</p>

<p>"Thank you, you are very good," replied Ned;
"but I hate to dispossess you."</p>

<p>"Pray don't mention it. You see I have often
heard of you and your shipmate, and I am as glad
as anyone of your deserved promotion. I only
hope that it may be permanent."</p>

<p>An inspection of Herc's cabin next door followed.
It was smaller and very much plainer
than Ned's and contained no desk and only two
chairs. But had it been Aladdin's palace, it could
not have gratified Herc's delighted eyes any more
than it did.</p>

<p>"But I'm forgetting something," said the Ensign
suddenly. "Let us go back to your cabin,
Mr. Strong. Your orders are on your desk.
You will also find a secret code book, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
you, only, will possess the key with one of your
junior officers, and signed copies of your commissions."</p>

<p>As Ned already knew that the orders under
which he sailed were sealed, he did not glance
over them just then. Instead, he let his eyes
feast on the engrossed copies of their commissions
and a document which stated that Lieutenant
Edward Strong was to take charge of the
gunboat <i>Seneca</i> till "further orders from this department,"
and that Ensign Hercules Taylor was
to be his second in command and assume such
duties as were assigned to him on board.</p>

<p>"And now, sir," suggested Ensign Summerville,
"the <i>Seneca</i> is under steam. She is ready
for your orders."</p>

<p>Ned thrilled at the sound of the words. This
trim little craft was absolutely at his command!</p>

<p>"First, however, you will no doubt wish to see
your other officers. There is Mr. Drayton, chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
engineer; Mr. Rankin, his assistant, but you have
already met him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have," rejoined Ned with a certain grim
note in his voice.</p>

<p>"We most certainly have," added Herc, in a
way which made the ensign give him a quick look
of understanding. He made no audible comment,
but those who knew Ensign Summerville would
have guessed from a peculiar expression that
came over his face that he recognized and sympathized
with the antipathy the boys had formed
for the assistant engineer.</p>

<p>"Our only other commissioned officer besides
yourselves is Mr. Kenworth, not long out of Annapolis.
Ah! there he is now. Kenworth, come
here a moment, will you?"</p>

<p>He addressed a tall, slender, very erect young
man in a midshipman's uniform who was just
passing through the wardroom.</p>

<p>"This is Lieutenant Strong, of whom I have
already told you. He assumes my command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
This is Mr. Taylor, the newly commissioned second
in command.</p>

<p>"Hullo, you fellows have met before?" he demanded
the next instant, for Kenworth had
drawn back slightly, a supercilious smile on his
thin, dark face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have met <i>Lieutenant</i> Strong as a
boatswain's mate," said Kenworth, with a disagreeable
intonation; "Mr. Taylor, too, I have
seen before the mast."</p>

<p>It was all true enough; both the Dreadnought
Boys had good cause to recollect Mr. Kenworth.
For a moment the air in the wardroom appeared
charged with electricity.</p>

<p>Ensign Summerville looked from one to the
other in surprise. He saw hauteur and dislike
on Kenworth's face, a look that might have
meant anything on Ned's countenance and undisguised
disgust on Herc's freckled features.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MIDSHIPMAN KENWORTH.</p>


<p>It had all happened back early in the naval careers
of young Strong and his chum Taylor.
Kenworth, a sprig just out of Annapolis, had
come to the <i>Manhattan</i> with an idea not uncommon
among young gentlemen just out of the
Academy, that next to the captain he was probably
the most important person on the ship.</p>

<p>To strengthen him in this belief, he had influential
relatives who had promised to smooth
out his path in life for him. Despite this fact,
though, Kenworth was still a midshipman. Why
was this, when many of his own class had passed
him?</p>

<p>Possibly the incident which Ned and Herc had
such good cause to recollect will throw a sidelight
on Mr. Kenworth's character that may
serve to explain this condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>It was one night when the wind was blowing
"great guns." Ned and Herc, the former then
a coxswain, were part of a crew sent to bring
some young officers off to the ship from Guantanamo
harbor. As it happened, the young officers
were all middies and, by right of length of
service, Kenworth outranked them.</p>

<p>He was quarrelsome and inclined to be obstreperous
when he came on board. He began
by abusing Ned, who had incurred Kenworth's
ill-will by his sturdy independence and the steady
command of his temper, even under the fledgling
officer's insults and slurs.</p>

<p>The boat put off with a sea running that
threatened momentarily to swamp her. It required
the whole strength of Ned's arm to keep
the craft, which was deeply loaded, headed into
the seas in such a way as to insure safety.</p>

<p>"Let her off a point there, you," ordered Kenworth,
when they had proceeded a short distance.</p>

<p>"It will hardly be safe, sir," rejoined Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hang your impudence," cried young Kenworth;
"do what I tell you, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," and sorely against his will
Ned did let the boat's head swing a trifle.</p>

<p>The instant result was what he had anticipated.
The crest of a sea broke on them, drenching
Kenworth to the skin. He flew into a frenzy
of rage.</p>

<p>"You clumsy, incompetent nincompoop," he
sputtered, "I'll have you up at the mast for that."</p>

<p>"I obeyed your orders, sir," rejoined Ned
simply, knowing there was nothing to be gained
by getting into an argument with an officer.</p>

<p>"Don't answer me, sir!" howled Kenworth.
"Confound your impudence!"</p>

<p>"Oh, look here, Kenworth," remonstrated another
midshipman. "It wasn't his fault. He
told you it wouldn't do and you insisted."</p>

<p>"And got jolly well wet for your pains," came
from one of the men at the oars in a low voice
intended only for his mate's ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>But Kenworth heard him, heard, too, the
smothered laugh from the men, none of whom
bore him any liking, his ways having made him
the most unpopular officer on the ship.</p>

<p>"How dare you make such a remark to me,
sir?" he demanded of Ned, choosing in his anger
to make a victim of the man he disliked most.</p>

<p>"I said nothing, sir," rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>"That's right; he didn't utter a word," came
from another midshipman.</p>

<p>"He'll sing a different tune at the mast to-morrow,
insolent waterfront scum," gritted out
Kenworth.</p>

<p>He said no more, but the next day the word
was passed forward by the sergeant-at-arms for
Ned to appear "at the mast," the man-o'-war
tribunal where the captain deals out justice.
Luckily Ned had no difficulty in clearing himself,
thanks to friendly witnesses, and Kenworth was
privately reprimanded by the captain for bringing
a trumped-up charge against an enlisted man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>From that day on, Kenworth had nourished
such a hatred of Ned as only a mean nature like
his could cherish. He never, while he remained
on the <i>Manhattan</i>, lost a chance to "work him
up," as it is called. On one occasion, he went
so far as to order Ned to count the sails of every
ship in the harbor of Hong Kong and report
their number to him.</p>

<p>Ned stood at the rail with a grave face for an
hour enjoying the scenery, and then, stepping up
to Kenworth, who was swelling with importance
as officer of the deck, he saluted with a quiet
smile.</p>

<p>"Well, did you do what I told you?" blustered
Kenworth.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there are just three thousand nine
hundred and ninety-five," replied Ned with great
gravity.</p>

<p>Kenworth looked sharply at him.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I counted them, sir," was the reply. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
can check up my count if you like, sir; you'll find
it correct."</p>

<p>As Ned saluted and turned away, he heard a
burst of laughter at Kenworth's expense from
some Jackies who had heard the little dialogue,
and who discreetly vanished before the arrogant
middie's wrath could descend on them. Soon
after this Kenworth had left the <i>Manhattan</i> and
Ned lost all track of him; not, indeed, that he
felt any great interest in the matter.</p>

<p>And now, by a strange quip of circumstance,
they had come face to face once more in the
wardroom of the little gunboat. But now their
positions were reversed. Ned was in command,
Herc was his second in authority, with Kenworth,
although he shaved daily and boasted a
blue chin, still a midshipman.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to meet Mr. Kenworth again,"
he said, when he had recovered his self-possession;
"I recollect him on the <i>Manhattan</i> very well
indeed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Kenworth mumbled something about duty aft
and hurried off. Ensign Summerville saw that
there was an embarrassing situation in the air
and hastened to suggest that they go on deck,
where he would have the crew mustered and
formally turn over the command of the Seneca
to Ned.</p>

<p>The crew was piped to quarters and the ensign
handed Ned a complete roster of the men. The
shrill sounds of the bos'un's whistles filled the
air, reminding Ned and Herc of the days when
a response was part of their duty.</p>

<p>The inspection did not last long. It was actually
more a ceremony of introduction. When
it was over, the ensign tarried to help Ned in
working out his course into the Sound.</p>

<p>"I would suggest that Mr. Kenworth take the
ship out to deep water, as he knows the channels
hereabouts thoroughly," said the ensign, as he
bade good-by to the new commander of the
<i>Seneca</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Kenworth, you will take the bridge,
then," said Ned.</p>

<p>Kenworth saluted and hurried off to take his
post. But as he did so, he grinned to himself.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" he exclaimed. "I think I see a
chance to take the wind out of your sails before
very long, you beggar on horseback, you forecastle
Jack on the quarter deck! If I don't fix
you and your ambitions and double spike 'em
before this cruise is over, my name isn't Raymond
Kenworth."</p>

<p>Swords were removed and sent below as soon
as Ensign Summerville was over the side.</p>

<p>While waiting for the gig to return, Ned and
Herc lingered over the charts and gave a few
necessary orders.</p>

<p>"Well, Ned," confided Herc in a lull, "this is
actually real after all."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that, old boy. I'm crazy to get
under way and look at my orders. Who knows
what they may contain and what lies before us?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>What, indeed, did the future hold for these
two ambitious young officers of Uncle Sam's?
They were destined to learn ere long. Over the
horizon of that day of life lay new experiences to
be met, new problems and dangers to be faced
like officers and gentlemen and true Americans.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AGROUND!</p>


<p>The anchor was hauled up immediately on the
return of the gig. The crews of the submarines,
already on board the diving craft, took their stations.
"Captain" Ned gave the word and the
<i>Seneca</i> began to move slowly through the water.</p>

<p>Having superintended the work of getting
under way, Ned and Herc ascended to the bridge.
They found Midshipman Kenworth there, standing
by the side of the quartermaster, who had
the wheel.</p>

<p>Behind the wheel, which was a small, light
affair controlling the steam steering gear, was a
small house in which the machinery that operated
the rudder control was situated.</p>

<p>Ned caught Herc by the sleeve just as the red-headed
lad was stepping impulsively forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and drew him into the doorway of the structure.
There was a small port in the place looking out
over the bridge. It was open, and through it
they could readily see.</p>

<p>"What's the idea of this?" demanded Herc.
"I don't like this spying business. I've no use
for Kenworth, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," responded Ned. "I don't
wish to spy on the young man; I merely want to
find out what sort of a pilot he is."</p>

<p>They skirted the little cape that formed the
end of the island, in the lee of which the <i>Seneca</i>
had been anchored. Beyond this island, the boys,
somewhat to their surprise, saw that there was
still quite an expanse of shoal water threaded
by narrow channels between the outer island and
the blue of the Sound itself.</p>

<p>"Ticklish work through here," commented
Ned in a low tone, as he observed how the darker
color of the channels that threaded the numerous
shallow places alternated with broad expanses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
yellow water that showed the presence of dangerous
sand banks.</p>

<p>"You're dead right," responded Herc; "about
as bad a place as I ever clapped eyes on."</p>

<p>The rattle and roar of the steering machinery
as the wheel was spun right and left drowned
the sound of their voices. Kenworth was looking
straight ahead. From time to time they could
see him turn slightly and give some order to the
helmsman; but what the orders were they could
not catch.</p>

<p>The <i>Seneca</i> appeared to be following the channel
perfectly, however, winding among the mazes
of deeper waterways like a dancer.</p>

<p>"Kenworth is no slouch at this work," said
Ned in a low voice as they watched.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" grunted Herc, "I guess the <i>Seneca</i>
has been in and out of here a hundred times.
Anyhow, a blind man could see those channels."</p>

<p>Ned turned on his companion with a stern
look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here, Herc Taylor, we want peace and
harmony on this craft; do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Even if we have to scrap to get it," muttered
Herc. "All right; from now on, I'm the greatest
little peace delegate ever you saw."</p>

<p>A minute later, while they were still watching,
they saw something that gave them a momentary
shock of surprise. Rankin appeared on the
bridge. There was nothing extraordinary in his
so doing, of course. He probably had something
to report to the watch officer.</p>

<p>But somehow Ned, with a quick flash of intuition
that he could not explain, felt that more
than that lay in this sudden conjunction of their
two enemies; for that Rankin disliked them, Ned
had no doubt.</p>

<p>He laid a hand on Herc's arm to keep him
quiet, for the impulsive red-headed youth was
about, apparently, to break forth into some emphatic
exclamation at what he had just seen.</p>

<p>Rankin approached Kenworth with an air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
familiarity that showed there existed some
friendship between them. Kenworth greeted him
with an easy nod, and then, after giving some
directions to the man at the wheel, he placed
his hand on Rankin's shoulder and drew him
back toward the steering-gear house.</p>

<p>"Come back here while we talk," the boys
heard him say, "I don't want that quartermaster
to overhear us."</p>

<p>For a moment it appeared that they were coming
into the steering house, but they merely stood
close back against its metal wall. They had
taken up positions right under the porthole
through which Ned had been making his observations.</p>

<p>But they had not seen their superior officers.
Ned had been too quick for that. As the two
approached the steering-gear structure, he
grabbed Herc and drew him down. Now they
crouched quietly under the porthole, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
which they could catch perfectly everything that
was said.</p>

<p>"Well, here's a fine how-de-do," they heard
Rankin complain in a grumbling tone; "a couple
of snips that aren't dry behind the ears been set
over us. I thought you were to get the command
when Summerville left."</p>

<p>"So did I; but it seems these two interlopers
succeeded in getting it for themselves."</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me that they started in the
navy just as enlisted men?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the gutter-snipes never saw even the
outside of Annapolis. I'd like to know what
the service is coming to when good men are
passed over for useless propositions like this!"</p>

<p>"So would I. By the way, I had a row with
them on the train coming down. They've no
use for me, I fancy. I wish I could hit upon
some plan to take them down a peg or two."</p>

<p>"I have," was Kenworth's rejoinder, in a tone
which was acid with malignant hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have what?"</p>

<p>"Formed such a plan. I've got a scheme to
discredit them with the department right from
the jump."</p>

<p>"Shoal ahead, sir!"</p>

<p>The voice of the man at the wheel cut in raspingly
like a file. Kenworth sprang up. Ned also
ventured to steal a look through the port. He
saw the shoal the helmsman had drawn attention
to, a long daub of yellow stretching on their port
bow.</p>

<p>He saw in a flash that there was only one
way to save the ship from going aground.</p>

<p>"Stay here," he ordered Herc, and then
bounded out of the steering-gear house, colliding
with Rankin as he did so.</p>

<p>"What, you here, sir?" exclaimed Rankin with
a sickly smile as Ned shoved past him. The
Dreadnought Boy, with a sinking sense of dread,
guessed somehow that already the conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
against him was under way, and that, with the
flukes of the anchor not yet dry at the cat-head!</p>

<p>Rankin reeled and staggered as Ned brushed
by with scant regard for gentleness. He turned
and gazed after the figure of the young officer
as he made for the steersman. Kenworth already
stood at the man's side.</p>

<p>"Hard a'port!" Ned heard Kenworth roar.</p>

<p>It was precisely the command that, under the
circumstances, would bring the bow of the
<i>Seneca</i> grating and rasping on the shoal.</p>

<p>"Hard over! Hard over! For your life,
man!" shouted Ned.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" cried the man, recognizing the
superior authority of the temporary commander.</p>

<p>But it was too late. The next instant it happened,
even as Ned's hand jerked the engine-room
telegraph over to "Full speed astern."
With a grating, jarring succession of bumps, the
<i>Seneca</i>, Ned's first command, slipped upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
shoal, even while her reversed engines were
frantically biting the water astern.</p>

<p>Before the lad's eyes arose a sickening vision
of failure and disgrace, even at the very outset
of his important commission.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"YOUR DUTY IS TO OBEY!"</p>


<p>It was no time then to try to fix the blame.
Turning to Kenworth, who was standing with
chalky-white face by his side, Ned curtly ordered
him to go below and summon the engineer and
the ship's armorers to the bridge.</p>

<p>When they came, he gave swift, incisive orders
to have the ship examined from stem to stern,
and any damage she might have sustained reported
to him immediately. Herc, who by this
time of course was by his young leader's side,
was ordered to take charge of this work.</p>

<p>The next half hour was the most anxious Ned
had ever passed; but he knew that yet more
suspense was bound to follow when it came to
testing how hard and fast the <i>Seneca</i> was piled
on the shoal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a possibility that she might get off
under her own steam. But of course this could
not be foretold till an actual trial could be made.
For the present, with engines that had ceased
revolving, the <i>Seneca</i> lay helpless and motionless
on the shoal.</p>

<p>Ned's naval training stood him in good stead
then. Without a quiver of a lip or a flicker of
an eyelid to betray the ordeal through which he
was passing, he stood erect on the bridge awaiting
the report of the investigators. Only the
pallor under his tanned cheeks showed what he
was enduring.</p>

<p>If naval tugs had to be sent for to extricate
the <i>Seneca</i> from her predicament, Ned knew that
his brief career as a naval commander was over
before it had well begun. Then, too, with this
thought mingled another.</p>

<p>Had Kenworth deliberately given the order
that had resulted in the grounding of the ship,
or had he lost his head and "piled her up"?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Judging from the conversation he had overheard,
Kenworth was determined to stop at nothing to
discredit and disgrace Herc and himself with the
Navy Department.</p>

<p>But it was inconceivable, almost, that he should
have formed his plan and executed it so quickly.
Ned was more inclined to put the entire affair
down to stupidity. But he knew that as commander
of the <i>Seneca</i>, he, and not Kenworth,
would assuredly be held responsible for any
damage done.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that he was aroused
by the clicking and whining of the wireless spark
in its little metal house just abaft of the funnel.
The stinging, whip-like crack and the crepitant
sputter of the spark as it leaped back and forth
across its gap like a caged animal was borne
with clean-cut distinctness to his ears.</p>

<p>"Somebody working the wireless," decided
Ned, for the arrival of a message is not attended
by any sound audible outside the ear receivers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
"Who can it be? Trevor, the regular wireless
man, is off duty. He was one of the emergency
gang I sent below with all the other hands I
could spare."</p>

<p>There followed a moment of indecision, and
then a flame of anger swept Ned's face.</p>

<p>Whoever was sending out those thundering
detonations of electricity that were splitting space
like a scimitar was no novice. Moreover, he was
trying to raise the <i>Manhattan</i>, the flagship of
the Red Squadron, and using the secret code to
do it.</p>

<p>"I'll find out what this means in two shakes,"
exclaimed Ned to himself. "I miss my guess if
it isn't somebody trying, absolutely without orders,
to flash news of this accident to the flagship
and put me in bad."</p>

<p>He hastened from the bridge to the upper deck
and through an alleyway to where a short flight
of steel steps led to the wireless room, perched
like a miniature pilot house astern of the funnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>As he gained the door of the place and looked
in, he stopped as abruptly as if he had been
struck a blow in the face.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood there rigid, taking in
the picture that had suddenly presented itself to
his indignant gaze.</p>

<p>Bending over the key and sending out impatient
waves of sound into the atmosphere was
Kenworth. His pale face was alight with poisonous
glee, as again and again he sent out the
secret call for the flagship of the Reds.</p>

<p>Ned was into the room in a bound. In another
instant he had Kenworth by the collar. The
astonished and startled midshipman was as helpless
as a puppy in Ned's powerful grasp.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;how&mdash;what's the matter?" he sputtered.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Mr. Kenworth?"
demanded Ned sternly. He was in no mood to
be trifled with. He fancied now that he saw the
whole contemptible plot, swiftly as the storm had
broken.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir&mdash;I&mdash;that is, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Answer me at once, please. What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought I'd practice up a bit."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Ned's eyes blazed and a dangerous flicker of
white came around his nostrils. He despised a
liar more than he held contempt for a coward,
and if he was not much mistaken, Kenworth was
both.</p>

<p>"You see," stuttered Kenworth, absolutely
shaken and flaccid, "I'm wireless officer, with
Trevor as assistant. I'm not very good yet, and
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it strikes me that you are
remarkably efficient, Mr. Kenworth," snapped
Ned; "and as for practicing, you assuredly
choose an extraordinary time for it when the
ship, for anything you know, is in danger."</p>

<p>"Danger?" exclaimed Kenworth, and Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
thought that he caught an evil glint in the midshipman's
eyes.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," rejoined Ned
coldly. "Tell me if you can, why, without orders
and without informing anyone, you were in here
trying to raise the <i>Manhattan</i>. You are silent.
Then I will tell you myself. You wanted to send
out word of the accident."</p>

<p>Kenworth shuffled from foot to foot uneasily.</p>

<p>"My duty&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>Then Ned boiled over.</p>

<p>"Your duty, Mr. Kenworth, is to obey my
orders. You will now oblige me by going to
your cabin, unless you wish me to adopt harsher
measures."</p>

<p>With a half-hearted salute, Kenworth turned
and without a word left the wireless room. But
as he descended the companionway stairs he muttered
to himself:</p>

<p>"I guess I've got you badly worried already,
Mr. Monkey-on-a-Stick, and this is only the beginning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
I said I'd fix you and I will, too. If
only I could have raised the <i>Manhattan</i> and got
that message through with my version of the
accident, Master Ned Strong's career would have
ended with a hard bump."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"THE EYES OF THE RED FLEET."</p>


<p>While Kenworth, in his cabin, was consoling
himself for his smart "dressing down" from Ned
with the reflection that in the event of the <i>Seneca</i>
being badly damaged the lad he so disliked would
lose his berth, Ned, on deck, had forgotten in
the business of the moment the incident of the
intercepted wireless.</p>

<p>Herc reported that no serious strain had been
found, and that so far as could be seen the <i>Seneca</i>
was resting on the edge of a sand bank. The
tide, it had been ascertained, was rising, in itself
a fortunate circumstance, and within a short
time things would be propitious for an attempt
to back the craft off under her own steam.</p>

<p>"I hope to goodness we succeed, old fellow,"
said Ned fervently, "although I can't tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
what an unspeakable relief to me it has been to
know that we are not damaged."</p>

<p>"You can rest assured of that. Every plate
and rivet from fore-peak to shaft tunnel has
been gone over. Not a drop of water anywhere."</p>

<p>"In that case, provided we can get afloat again
without summoning assistance, we may get by
without a reprimand or, even worse, a recall,"
declared Ned.</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be terrible!" exclaimed Herc.
"But say, Ned, have you done any thinking about
this accident?"</p>

<p>"What a question to ask! Thinking! I've
been doing nothing else since we struck."</p>

<p>"But you know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Putting two and two together?" asked Ned
significantly, with a glance at the steering-wheel
house that had been their place of concealment.</p>

<p>"That's it exactly. Have you been doing that?"</p>

<p>"Hum, yes, but they don't make four&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"But you've come to the conclusion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
accident may not have been quite so accidental
as it appeared?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say so. What I do say, though, is
this, that there is one person on board who was
quite willing to take advantage of it, accident or
no accident, to discredit us."</p>

<p>"And that was&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Midshipman Kenworth. The rascal!
caught him in the wireless room trying to send
a message to the <i>Manhattan</i>."</p>

<p>Ned went on to relate all that had occurred
at that momentous encounter, being frequently
interrupted by Herc's exclamations of indignation.</p>

<p>"You ought to have Kenworth put in the brig,
or at least keep him in his cabin for the rest of
the cruise," blustered Herc.</p>

<p>"How can I do that? I have no proof against
the fellow. Suspicion is one thing, proof quite
another."</p>

<p>"Anyone who knows the fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's quite aside from the question. Kenworth
has powerful influences behind him. We
don't want to make any more enemies than we
have to."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! If I had your powers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I had the proof, I'd act quick enough, you
may be sure. I wouldn't care if his father was
Secretary of the Navy&mdash;yes, or President. All
the more reason for getting rid of such a scalawag.
But as it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All ready, sir!"</p>

<p>The chief bos'un's mate made the announcement.</p>

<p>"Very well, Bowles. You may pass the word."</p>

<p>"Now for the tug-of-war," said Ned grimly,
as, warning the man at the wheel to keep his
helm hard over, he sent the signal below for the
engines to be started at reverse "slow."</p>

<p>Once more the vibration of her machinery
thrilled the hull of the <i>Seneca</i>; but&mdash;she did not
move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Undisturbed, so far as anyone could see, Ned
shoved the telegraph over till little by little the
pointer stopped at "Full speed astern." He rang
up on the bridge telephone.</p>

<p>"Give her every ounce you've got," he ordered.</p>

<p>The water churned whitely; the pipes of the
safety valves roared with the pressure of the
escaping steam from the high-pressure boilers.
The <i>Seneca</i> shook and trembled like a live thing.
Then came a sudden impulse. Ned's eyes began
to dance, but he dared not speak.</p>

<p>The next instant he knew that he had not been
mistaken. The <i>Seneca</i> was moving.</p>

<p>A cheer burst from the men, who knew that
Ned had risen from the foredeck, and liked and
admired him on that account. Nobody attempted
to check it. Below, in his cabin, Kenworth heard
the cheer and felt the slight movement.</p>

<p>"Confound him! So he has managed to get
her afloat, after all," he muttered. "I didn't pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
her up quick enough. Well, I'll get another
chance, and this time I won't fall down."</p>

<p>Little by little the bulk of the gunboat began
to slide backward off the shoal.</p>

<p>From the leadsmen posted on the bow, bridge
and stern, came every moment cries announcing
deeper and deeper water. Herc silently wrung
Ned's hand. Ned said nothing, but his face
showed what he felt.</p>

<p>At last there came a sudden backward lurch
and the gunboat was freed from her sandy prison
and floated in deep water once more.</p>

<p>"We'll have no pilot this time," declared Ned,
as he himself took the guidance of the ship, scanning
the waters ahead with keen eyes and directing
the helmsman on his course. They reached
open water without accident. And then Ned was
at leisure to forward his report of the accident
to the <i>Manhattan</i>.</p>

<p>To his relief no comment was made upon it,
which he attributed to the fact that there had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
been no serious results. But through the air
came an order that caused Ned to thrill with
delight. He was commanded to peruse his sealed
orders and follow them out without delay.</p>

<p>The <i>Manhattan</i> was then some miles north of
Block Island, well out to sea with the Red Squadron.
Of the Blues, nothing had been heard.</p>

<p>It was for Ned's ship, as the "Eyes of the Red
Fleet" to spy out and report the whereabouts of
the "enemy."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE EAVESDROPPER.</p>


<p>Ned, after the receipt of the message authorizing
him to open his orders, lost no time in hastening
below.</p>

<p>Herc, as his junior officer, went with him.
Kenworth was ordered out of his cabin and told
off to assume charge of the after-watch, an assignment
on which Ned was sure the evilly disposed
midshipman could not do any harm.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the ship was steaming slowly
down the Sound in charge of one of the junior
warrant officers.</p>

<p>"Now for the big secret," exclaimed Ned, as
he opened his desk and took out the slender
package. "We'll step into the wardroom to look
it over, Herc."</p>

<p>"Look out, somebody may have put a bomb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in it while we were gone," warned Herc, leaning
over Ned's shoulder, a look of intense interest on
his freckled countenance.</p>

<p>"Hardly any danger of that, I think," laughed
Ned.</p>

<p>He ripped open the envelope, glanced hastily
at the first sheet of the numerous typewritten
pages it contained, and gave vent to a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?" gasped
Herc. "I thought we were to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Obey orders," said Ned quietly; "although I
must admit this is a bit of a surprise. I suppose
a change in plans came late so that we were not
forewarned."</p>

<p>"Well, let's hear what it is all about," prompted
Herc impatiently.</p>

<p>"Simple enough, apparently. The army folks
are protecting the mouth of the harbor. There
are important fortifications there, because in time
of war the protecting fleet, or part of it, might
gather there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"The army folks have planted mines there.
While watching for the Blue fleet to arrive, we
are to test those mines."</p>

<p>"Phew!" gasped Herc. "There's only one way
to test how much kick there is to a mine."</p>

<p>"And what's that?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"To blow it up and&mdash;yourself with it," declared
Herc sententiously. "Well, for a nice little holiday
job, we have sure picked a dandy."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, will you?" interrupted Ned.
"Let me finish this. The mines are wired up by
a new system. What we have to find out is if
we can sneak into the harbor mouth in our submarines
and disconnect the firing wires of the
mines without blowing ourselves up. If we can
do this, the system is a failure."</p>

<p>"Humph! and so are we."</p>

<p>"So are we what?"</p>

<p>"Failures! If one of these mines blew up,
what else would we be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned exploded in a loud laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, you chump," he exclaimed, "they are
not loaded mines!"</p>

<p>"Then how can they tell if they've been exploded
or not when we go submarining around
them?"</p>

<p>"It's up to us to see if we can dodge the wires
or contrive some way to disconnect them."</p>

<p>"That disconnecting idea doesn't appear very
feasible."</p>

<p>"No, it does not," agreed Ned; "but I think I
can find a way to evade them, for all that."</p>

<p>"Hum! So long as they're not loaded, I don't
care even if we run bumpety-bang into one," declared
Herc; "but a loaded mine&mdash;no, thank you!"</p>

<p>"Our orders after that are general. We are
to use our own discretion entirely, acting as the
eyes and ears of the Red fleet, and forwarding to
the flagship, via wireless, every scrap of information
we think might be valuable to the attacking
party."</p>

<p>"That's one thing I don't like about this command,"
muttered Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, we're supposed to be enemies to the
flag."</p>

<p>"But only supposed to be, Herc, for the purposes
of perfecting the strength of Uncle Sam's
defenses, and playing a useful part in exposing
any weakness in our nation's fortifications."</p>

<p>"Huh; well, that's all the kind of enemy I ever
want to be&mdash;a supposed one."</p>

<p>"I'm going into my cabin to lay out our
course," said Ned, after a few more words.
"I want you on deck, Herc, to see how things
are going on. It won't take me long and&mdash;&mdash; What
on earth is the matter? Got a stroke?"</p>

<p>There was a large glass skylight over the
wardroom and, owing to the warmth of the
weather, the flaps of this had been raised. With
the expression of one who has been suddenly
hypnotized, Herc was staring with open eyes and
mouth straight up at the wardroom roof.</p>

<p>"What do you see?" demanded Ned, springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to his feet. "Shall I get you a glass of water?
Shall I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Umph! You might get me a gun," snorted
Herc.</p>

<p>"A gun! What on earth do you want with a
gun?"</p>

<p>"I want it to shoot a skunk!"</p>

<p>"A skunk! Do you think you're back on the
farm?"</p>

<p>"No, but just the same I'd like to go gunning
with grandpap's old scatter gun."</p>

<p>"I wish we had a doctor on board, Herc. Any
fellow who can go around seeing skunks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ought to shoot 'em on sight," muttered Herc
belligerently. "Well, Ned, this was a skunk I
saw, all right, all right! And what do you think
his name was?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, Herc rushed on,
"Kenworth! He'd been listening to every word
we were saying!"</p>

<p class="chaptitle">SAKI&mdash;STEWARD.</p>


<p>For the time being there was no opportunity
to investigate the case of the eavesdropper. It
was important that they should get under way at
once. Herc hastened on deck after a few hurried
words with Ned.</p>

<p>Just at that moment two bells&mdash;one o'clock&mdash;sounded
in the slow, deep, mellow tones of the
ship's bell. Simultaneously there appeared,
through a doorway at one end of the wardroom,
the figure of a dapper Japanese, dressed in white
garments.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Who are you?" demanded Ned, looking
up from a reverie into which he had fallen,
following Herc's departure.</p>

<p>"Me Saki. Officer steward. Me getee lunch
for honorable capitan," rejoined the Jap with a
low bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Summerville made no mention to me of
you," said Ned, looking the Jap over.</p>

<p>"No doubt, sir, no doubt," was the reply; "me
only joinee ship in New York."</p>

<p>Ned said no more, but, telling the steward to
summon him when the meal was ready, he resumed
his meditations. Truly the young skipper
of the <i>Seneca</i> was in need of time to think and
ponder.</p>

<p>This command of his, of which he had been
so proud, evidently was not going to prove any
sinecure. Then, somehow, the face of the Jap
floated before his mind. He had seen it somewhere
before, he was certain. Perhaps it was on
some other naval craft, for Japanese stewards
are much affected in the United States Navy.</p>

<p>It was a striking face, too: thick, bushy hair
brushed up above a massive forehead, far squarer
and more prominent than Jap's foreheads usually
are, forming a sort of bristly aureole for a yellow
face with dark, forbidding eyebrows and a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
jaw. Saki was not a common type of Jap. He
was heavier, less obsequious and smiling, more
sure of himself.</p>

<p>But such thoughts quickly flitted from Ned's
mind as the problem of Kenworth put itself forward.
Mated with this reflection came the image
of Rankin. Both were men who disliked and, in
one case at least, hated Ned and Herc.</p>

<p>True, Rankin had no cause but a purely unreasonable
one&mdash;as it were&mdash;for his antipathy to
the young captain of the <i>Seneca</i> and his first
officer, but it was none the less plain, even without
taking the overheard conversation on the
bridge into account, that the man had made up
his mind to do all the harm he could.</p>

<p>How soon he would strike, of course, Ned had
no idea; nor what form his malice would take.
That Ned had concluded that Kenworth had purposely
run upon the shoal, we already know, but
with how much justice he had arrived at such a
deduction, he could not determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The course was soon worked out and Ned proceeded
to the chart house. He summoned Herc
and gave him his sailing directions, and then
proceeded to make an inspection of the ship. On
his return from this duty, he suddenly recollected
that he had left the door of his stateroom unlocked.</p>

<p>He descended the stairs swiftly and almost
noiselessly. As he reached the foot of them, he
saw a form suddenly emerge from his cabin and
glide silently as a cat across the wardroom in
the direction of the stern door, where he knew
the steward's cabin and pantry, as well as the
store-room, were located.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he called in a sharp, authoritative
voice.</p>

<p>"That you, Mr. Capitan, sir?" came in Saki's
voice. "Me just go by your cabin, tell you lunch
is ready, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Come here, Saki."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," rejoined Saki, hurrying back and
bowing low.</p>

<p>"You must never enter my cabin, do you understand?
That's private ground except when
I am in it. And Saki."</p>

<p>"Honorable naval mister." Saki again bowed
low, spreading his hands.</p>

<p>"Have I ever seen you before?"</p>

<p>"I have never had the felicity of looking upon
the honorable capitan's face."</p>

<p>"Very well. You may call Ensign Taylor."
For Ned and Herc, as befitted their respective
ranks on board the <i>Seneca</i>, ate their meals in
solitary state.</p>

<p>Midshipman Kenworth and the other warrant
officers followed them. Such was the strict etiquette
of the navy, even on so small a craft as
the <i>Seneca</i>.</p>

<p>"Funny," thought Ned, "it's odd, but I can't
get it out of my head that I <i>have</i> seen him before
somewhere. Jove! I have it! It was at Nagasaki,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
on the world cruise. He was found examining
guns and firing systems on board the <i>Manhattan</i>.
As he could give no satisfactory account
of himself, he was ejected. I'm sure it's the same
man. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the entrance of Herc put a stop to further
speculation. Saki waited on them during the
meal with silent dexterity. Once or twice Ned
sought a chance to study his face without being
observed, but every time he found that the Jap's
eyes were fixed on him, although quickly averted
when the Oriental saw that he was being noticed.</p>

<p>After lunch he took an opportunity to make
some inquiries concerning the Jap, and learned
that he had come on board at New York, as he
had said. Midshipman Kenworth was believed
to have secured him, the Jap having been highly
recommended as a servant by a relative of the
former.</p>

<p>"Kenworth, again," muttered Ned to himself.
"It's odd, very odd, how he is always bobbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
up. Jove," he broke off suddenly, "I never
thought to overhaul that desk of mine. The
way that Jap came out of there like a rabbit out
of a hole was suspicious, to say the least. I'll
go below and have a look."</p>

<p>But a narrow inspection of the cabin showed
that nothing had been disturbed. Carefully Ned
locked up his orders in his desk, and when he
went out, secured the door.</p>

<p>"All right this time, but it's a risk I don't want
to chance again," he said to himself as he ascended
to the bridge. "Somehow I don't trust
that Jap, any more than I do those other fellows."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ANOTHER WATCHER.</p>


<p>By mid-afternoon the <i>Seneca</i> was well down
the Sound. Several times she was in communication
with the Red flagship, but no further
orders came to Trevor, who was at the key.</p>

<p>Nor had the flagship heard anything of the
whereabouts of the Blues. It was generally believed
that they had rallied off the Virginia Capes
and were playing a game of hide-and-seek with
their opponents.</p>

<p>Ned knew the spot to which he had been
directed for the mine test very well. Already he
had planned just how he would proceed. From
the mainland at this point there runs out a long
finger of land, on one end of which is perched
Fort Schuyler.</p>

<p>It was his intention to leave the <i>Seneca</i> anchored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in a bay far up the Sound and then proceed
on one of the submarines, under cover of
night, himself commanding the diving boat. But
when they had almost reached the snug bay that
Ned had decided upon as a good anchoring place
for a craft on such an errand, Trevor hastened
out of his wireless box with a message in the
secret code.</p>

<p>Ned took it below and speedily read it off. He
made a wry face of chagrin as he did so. It
appeared that other work than going down with
the submarine had been laid out for him. He
was to get ashore somehow, land on the neck in
the early morning, and make certain observations
of the work of the diving boat.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Ned to himself; "too bad!
I don't see the object of it all, but I suppose they
know best. Well, Herc will have to take command
of the submarine, of course, and I will
have to do what's laid out for me."</p>

<p>His mind at once began to busy itself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
plans for the morrow's work when Trevor suddenly
interrupted again. There had been a mistake
in transmitting the details of the last message,
it appeared.</p>

<p>The submarine was not to make the tests the
next day at all. Through other sources the flagship
had learned that the mines had not yet been
laid. Ned was to contrive to be on the watch
during the process and note carefully where each
was planted from a quartermaster's department
tug. This was very important, as the mines were
to be laid just as they would be for actual defenses.
When Ned had secured all this information,
the submarine test would come. If they
succeeded in dodging the torpedoes, it would be
several points for the Red side.</p>

<p>When they reached the bay that Ned had in
mind, the <i>Seneca</i> was guided inside, and then,
while her crew speculated as to what the next
move could possibly be, she lay swinging at her
anchor, idly waiting for darkness to fall. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Ned had decided not to let his crew know of the
plans. Herc, of course, was familiar with them,
but none of the others, except Trevor, the wireless
operator.</p>

<p>It was not long before dusk when Midshipman
Kenworth presented himself before Ned. He
saluted respectfully and appeared much more
obsequious than he had been since the arrival
of the boys on board.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, sir," he asked, "but would
there be any objection to my going ashore to-night?
Some of my people live at Oakhurst,
about nine miles inland, and I'd like to take this
opportunity of seeing them."</p>

<p>Ned thought a moment. Then he decided that
if Kenworth was spying about the <i>Seneca</i> with
the object of injuring her young skipper, the
further off he was during the next day the better.</p>

<p>"Very well, Kenworth," said he, "you may
go, but be sure to report on board to-morrow
night at four bells."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the midshipman, saluting. He
turned away and not long after reappeared on
deck with his suit case. The shore boat was
ordered away and was soon skimming off over
the water.</p>

<p>"Confound the fellow," said Ned to Herc as
they watched the craft making its way over the
bay, "I didn't want to let him go; but after all,
I'd rather have his room than his company any
day."</p>

<p>"I'd have kept him aboard and worked him
up to the king's taste," said Herc with positiveness.
"I've no more use for him than I have
for a snake in the grass, or for what I compared
him to before."</p>

<p>"After all, though, there is no possible way
he could injure us," declared Ned. "Such fellows
as he is generally end by hurting themselves
more than the folks they have it in for."</p>

<p>"That may all be as true as a preacher's words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Ned," declared Herc, "but we owe it to ourselves
to look out for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, that part of it is all right. But come on
now, I'm going to get ready for the trip that
I'm going to take to-night myself."</p>

<p>"I wish I were going with you," said Herc.</p>

<p>"Just think, you'll be able to lord it over the
ship as a skipper all the time I'm gone," laughed
Ned.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid a skipper with a red head won't
get as much respect as you do, Ned, but I'll do
my best."</p>

<p>After dark that night, Ned, clothed in an old
suit of civilian clothes, and carrying in a small
handbag some necessary instruments and a sketch
block for recording his impressions, clambered
down into the gig and was rowed ashore by two
members of the crew who had been sworn to
secrecy.</p>

<p>Once ashore, where there was a community of
summer cottages and hotels, he engaged a gasoline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
launch to take him to a small island known
as Civic Island, not far from the Neck, to which
it was joined, in fact, by a bridge.</p>

<p>Going ashore at Civic Island, Ned turned in
at a hotel and early in the morning rose, secured
some provisions which he placed in his small
handbag, and then set out on foot for the scene
of his observations.</p>

<p>The Neck was a lonely place and very little
frequented. On one end of it was the fort, between
which and some wooded heights in which
it terminated, stretched the sandy, brush-covered
peninsula of the Neck, scrawny and thin as that
of a giraffe.</p>

<p>Ned was provided with field glasses, of course,
and having reached a point from which he could
command a clear view of the fort, he surveyed
it for some time to get his bearings. Meanwhile,
of course, he concealed his body behind some
bushes.</p>

<p>He could see the tug perfectly plainly. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
was a big crane at its bow and it was hoisting
on board large metallic shapes of globular form
that he knew were mines.</p>

<p>At the top of the mast floated the flag of the
quartermaster's department, so that Ned knew
that he had the right craft spotted.</p>

<p>"Well, they are in no hurry, anyhow," he said
to himself, as he watched the leisurely way in
which the craft was being loaded. "I reckon I'll
sit down and take a rest. I didn't sleep much
at that hotel last night, and I'd be glad of a seat
in the shade. I can keep my eyes open just as
well under this bush here as standing out there
in the sun."</p>

<p>But alas for good intentions! As he cast himself
down in the shade, Ned appeared to slip
gently out of the present and into the land of
Nod. How long he slept he had no idea. But
it could not have been very long, for when he
opened his eyes again the tug, loaded with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
big, black bulks of the submarine mines, was just
leaving the fort.</p>

<p>"Gracious! Lucky I woke up in time! A fine
thing it would have been if I had blissfully slept
right on!" exclaimed Ned to himself in mortified
tones.</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet. The next instant he
threw himself just as hastily down again.</p>

<p>He was not alone on the Neck. Not far off
was a figure intently watching the tug as it slowly
steamed out from the dock.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">NED AT A DISADVANTAGE.</p>


<p>Reconnoitering cautiously from his point of
vantage behind the bush, Ned could not suppress
a start of surprise.</p>

<p>There was something familiar about the figure
of the fellow he was watching. Could it be&mdash;&mdash;?
Ned rubbed his eyes and looked again. Then
his lips came together in a firm, thin line. His
eyes hardened and his hands clenched.</p>

<p>"The infernal rascal!" he muttered.</p>

<p>He had not been mistaken when he thought
he recognized the figure that was watching the
tug as, with its crane stretched out like a long
pointing finger, it steamed out into the center of
the bay.</p>

<p>It was Midshipman Kenworth&mdash;Kenworth,
whom he supposed was visiting his relatives far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
inshore. Yet here he was in civilian clothes on
this lonesome, sandy spit of land, apparently as
much interested in the movements of the army
tug as Ned himself.</p>

<p>What could be the solution of the mystery?
Why had Kenworth come there?</p>

<p>A sinister thought flashed into Ned's mind.
The next instant suspicion became conviction.
He saw Kenworth draw out a pair of binoculars
and focus them on the moving tug. Then the
midshipman cast himself down into a sandy hollow,
over the breast of which he pointed his
binoculars at the tug.</p>

<p>"So-o-o-o! That's your little game, is it!"
breathed Ned disgustedly. "You're even blacker
than I thought you, Kenworth. I guess I'll take
a hand in this thing myself. Bagging a traitor
to Uncle Sam, and one who is entitled to wear
the uniform of an officer and a gentleman at
that, ought to be even more important than a
chart of the mine positions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the two, like a series of billows,
stretched wave-like sand dunes. They were covered
with a scant growth of wind-tortured beach
plum and stiff, spiky sea grass.</p>

<p>But yet the growth, scant as it was, afforded a
certain amount of cover. Ned's mind was soon
made up as to the course he would pursue. At
all hazards, it was important to catch Kenworth
red-handed.</p>

<p>"And yet, what can his motive be?" wondered
Ned to himself. "I can't conceive his purpose.
He cannot be making his plans and observations
for the benefit of the Blue fleet. If he dared
offer them there, he would be booted over the
flagship's side in two shakes. No, there is something
under all this that I haven't fathomed.
But I will."</p>

<p>Ned's firm chin closed on his jaw with a snap.
With stern purpose in his eyes, the young follower
of the flag began to creep forward over
the billowing sand dunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>His progress was slow, for although in the
hollows he had no fear of being seen, yet when
he breasted a rise he had to be careful. It was
when he had attained the summit of one of these
sandy acclivities that Ned noticed that the tug
had come to a standstill.</p>

<p>The crane arm swung inboard and one of the
mines, looking like a huge black shoe button, was
slowly hoisted from the pile on the deck. Then
through the still air came the rattling sound of
chains and the shrieking whir of the steam winch
as the mine was lowered.</p>

<p>From this, Ned turned his attention once more
to Kenworth. The midshipman was squatting
down in his hollow now, and with a note book
on his knees, was recording some sort of observations.</p>

<p>Risking detection, Ned centered his binoculars
on that note book. What he saw through the
powerful lenses caused him to flush angrily.
Kenworth was making, not without considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
draughtsman's skill, a sketch map of the whole
situation.</p>

<p>"Oh! you miserable wretch!" exclaimed Ned,
gritting his teeth. "I'd give a whole lot to get
my hands on you for about five minutes, and
that's just what I'm going to do, too."</p>

<p>All unconscious of the concealed watcher, Kenworth
sketched on. He actually appeared to take
a pride in his work, from time to time holding
it at arm's length as if to get a better perspective
upon it. Then from his pocket he took a small
camera, and made some pictures of the two forts
and the stretch of water between.</p>

<p>"Great heavens! He's risking the loss of his
commission," exclaimed Ned to himself as he
saw. "There must be some uncommon motive
behind all this to make him take such chances.
What can it be?"</p>

<p>The tug was moving now, crawling like some
ungainly black bug across the shimmering water.</p>

<p>Once more the anchor rumbled down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
again the crane poised, swooped, and deposited
another of the globular black objects, piled on
the fore-deck, in the water.</p>

<p>Ned, watching Kenworth intently, saw him
place a surveyor's instrument to his eye, no doubt
to make a rough calculation of the exact spot of
the planting. Following a few seconds' observation
through this, he jotted down some more
notes in his book.</p>

<p>"He's taking pains to be quite accurate,"
thought Ned. "He goes about his work as if it
were some honorable duty he was engaged upon.
I wonder how he knew about the mine planting,
though? Can it be possible that he heard the
message coming over the wireless, or in some
manner gained access to a copy of it?"</p>

<p>Loyalty to his flag and country was the Dreadnought
Boy's ruling passion. The sight of Kenworth,
engaged upon what Ned was certain could
only be treacherous work, sent a flame that
seethed like a white-hot blast through his frame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Again he moved forward, but faster now.
Kenworth, all unconscious that another was
creeping up on him, resumed his seat in the
hollow and went on with the touching up of his
rough drawings.</p>

<p>Ned was close upon him now. Through the
grass he glided along like a snake.</p>

<p>But the rustle of some of the stiff grass behind
him, or the fall of a miniature cascade of sand
into his hollow, must have suddenly apprised
Kenworth that somebody was in the vicinity.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and looked about him.
At the same instant something leaped through
the air with the speed of a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>With a roar of rage, Ned had sprung the
instant that he saw that discovery was inevitable.</p>

<p>A sharp exclamation broke from Kenworth.</p>

<p>"You fool, I was prepared for you!"</p>

<p>Simultaneously something flashed bright in his
hand, glinting in the sunlight.</p>

<p>The next instant Ned felt a hot flash of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in his face and the stinging of a shower of
needles. He staggered back, his hands to his
eyes, as Kenworth, with a cry of triumph, sprang
toward the Dreadnought Boy's reeling figure.</p>

<p>"That's the time I got you, Mister Strong!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A PRISONER ON "THE NECK."</p>


<p>But his triumph was just a little bit premature.
The bullet from the revolver which Kenworth
had so handy had only grazed Ned's cheek. It
was the powder grains that had stung him like
red-hot points.</p>

<p>The next instant he had recovered from his
temporary smoke blindness. As Kenworth
jumped for him, Ned sprang at the other. As
he did so, his arms shot out and Kenworth's pistol
went flying through the air.</p>

<p>Then Ned's strong hands seized the other's
wrists with the force of steel handcuffs.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" roared Kenworth. "I didn't
get you, did I?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet," panted Ned, "nor for some
time to come. You're my prisoner, and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
don't want to accompany me quietly I'll find
means to make you."</p>

<p>Kenworth's reply was an odd one. He uttered
a peculiar whistle.</p>

<p>"Now what's that for?" wondered Ned. The
question had hardly taken shape in his mind before
it was answered, and in a surprising manner.</p>

<p>A loop was thrown over him, he fell forward,
and his arms were pinioned by an irresistible
force to his side, while a knee pressed into the
small of his back.</p>

<p>"Honorable capitan lie quiet? No?" came a
voice in his ear.</p>

<p>"It's Saki! Let me go instantly," demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>A soft, gurgling laugh was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Yes, me Saki all right, honorable capitan;
but no can let you go. You lie down lilly while."</p>

<p>With a trick that Ned recognized as one employed
by the jiu-jitsu expert he had vanquished
in the Far East, the yellow-skinned rascal, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
spoke, threw Ned sprawling on his back on the
sand. Before he could make any defense another
loop was slipped over his legs.</p>

<p>"Help!" shouted the boy. "Help! Help!"</p>

<p>There was a chance that his voice might carry
to the distant tug.</p>

<p>"Ah! That velly bad to make noise, honorable
sir," came Saki's soft voice, and into the struggling
lad's mouth was thrust a not over-clean rag.</p>

<p>Effectually silenced now, Ned lay there with
blazing eyes. He was beaten, as he realized with
a bitter feeling at his heart. Saki and Kenworth
were in league, as he had half guessed before.</p>

<p>Kenworth's harsh laugh made him turn his
eyes in that worthy's direction.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like it, eh?" he chuckled.
"And you thought you could overreach me and
give me orders, did you? Just take that!"</p>

<p>The young ruffian swung a fist crashingly into
his helpless victim's face. Again and again he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
struck, while Saki stood by, grinning. But suddenly
the Jap interfered.</p>

<p>"That plenty for now. We finish our work.
Then maybe soon we go way lilly while. Come
back night time. Takee honorable capitan nice
hotel."</p>

<p>The yellow man broke into a laugh as he spoke,
and Kenworth, flushed and vicious from his display
of vindictive fury, ceased belaboring Ned.
He turned again to his sketch book and spy
glasses. Saki took the opportunity to retrieve
the pistol, which he handed back to Kenworth.</p>

<p>"Maybe good thing you not better shot," he
chuckled, with sinister meaning.</p>

<p>The wind blew his coat aside as he stooped
over, and Ned saw that, pinned within it, the Jap
had a peculiar decoration. Ned knew what it
was. He had seen similar ones in the Far East
on the world cruise.</p>

<p>It was the badge denoting that the wearer belonged
to Samurai, or warrior caste of Japan. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
also was conferred as a decoration on certain
leaders after the Russo-Japanese war.</p>

<p>This Saki, then, was not the ship's steward, as
he had been masquerading. Instead, he was a
soldier and a veteran, and evidently, too, of high
rank.</p>

<p>The whole thing came over Ned in a flash.
What a fool he had been not to see through the
plot before. The Jap, whose creature Kenworth
plainly was, had seized the opportunity of the
great naval maneuvers to smuggle himself into
the midst of things and secure information about
Uncle Sam's fighting ships and war methods that
he could have gained in no other way.</p>

<p>The careful maps that Kenworth was drawing
were destined to be sent across the Pacific, for
what purpose Ned could guess. He turned eyes
that blazed slow fires of contempt upon Kenworth.</p>

<p>The latter laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Thinking you'd like to nail me, aren't you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
he sneered. "But you'd have to get up a little
earlier in the morning to do that. We knew
every one of your plans long ago. Saki got them
in your cabin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Japanese held up a warning hand.</p>

<p>"No talk any more. Hurry up your map," he
urged.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! what harm does it do to tell him a
few wholesome truths?" snarled Kenworth.
"He's had a swelled head too long altogether.
This is the time that he learns he's not as smart
as he thinks, by a whole lot."</p>

<p>But he regarded the Jap's hint and addressed
no more remarks to Ned. The Dreadnought Boy
lay on the hot sands with an ardent sun burning
down upon him. But he was careful to give no
sign of suffering, although his thirst was beginning
to be excessive.</p>

<p>As if he knew this, and delighted in torturing
the helpless lad, Saki, from time to time, drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
out an elaborately chased bottle and drank from
it with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Ah! nice, cool. Veree nice," he would say,
smacking his lips and proffering it to Kenworth.
"Lemonade, veree good 'Merican drink."</p>

<p>But Ned, without the quiver of an eyelid, lay
gazing up into the blazing firmament, although
his throat felt as if it were cracking from a
drought of centuries.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE FRIENDLY SUN.</p>


<p>The sun grew hotter and hotter. From the
whirring of winches and the clanking rattle of
chains that was borne shoreward from time to
time, Ned knew that the work of mine-laying was
still going on. The work he had been sent to
report!</p>

<p>What would be thought of him by his superiors?
He felt that it was doubtful if they would
believe his story, even supposing he ever got back
to his ship and was able to tell it.</p>

<p>He wondered what his captors meant to do
with him. Reasoning it out, he had not much
fear that they would attempt any desperate
course, but they were certain to place him where
he could not give the alarm and cause their pursuit
before they had had an opportunity to get
clear away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Mingled with these reflections came others.
Ned speculated vainly as to how long this treachery
had been going on. Probably for some time;
Kenworth's note book appeared well filled.
Doubtless he had become disgusted with what
he deemed the unfair treatment accorded him in
the navy, and had fallen an easy prey to the foreign
agents who are constantly trying to discover
for their countries the secrets of Uncle
Sam's coast defenses and naval arrangements.</p>

<p>But it is rarely indeed that there is found in
either branch of the service men who have fallen
low enough to coöperate with these fellows.
From time to time, though, such dastards are
found and promptly weeded out. There was no
doubt but that Kenworth belonged to the latter
class.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Rankin does, also," thought Ned.
"He was a friend of Kenworth's. It's natural
he should be mixed up in his nefarious schemes
and plots."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>It must have been well after noon when Kenworth
reported that the tug had finished her work
and was going back.</p>

<p>"Then we go 'way," decided Saki. "Me plenty
hungry. Bimeby when get dark we come back
and keep you company, Honorable Strong."</p>

<p>"Yes, don't be afraid we'll forget you," sneered
Kenworth, putting up his note book; "you've suddenly
become important in my eyes."</p>

<p>Bestowing a parting kick on Ned's helpless
form, the miserable traitor followed Saki off
across the sand hills. Ned turned his eyes and
watched them as they went.</p>

<p>So they were going to leave him there on the
parching sand till nightfall, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ned, old boy, you're sure in a bad fix," said
the captive lad to himself. "There's not a chance
on earth of getting away from here, and even
if I could, I have failed in my mission."</p>

<p>The thought that he had not accomplished the
duty laid out for him pained the Dreadnought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Boy far more than the contemplation of his predicament.
With Ned, and with Herc, too, devotion
to their ideals of duty was almost a religion.
It is so with most of Uncle Sam's Jackies. But,
as we know, a few black sheep are bound to
crop up in every fold. Ned thought grimly that
he had certainly encountered his share.</p>

<p>The sun beat down hotter and hotter upon the
boy. Its rays burned his eyes. His lips were
swollen, his every bone aching. The tortures
of his thirst had almost reached the point of
delirium.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt an acute pain upon his hand.
It stung like the thrust of a red-hot knife.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" exclaimed Ned, and rolled over a
little.</p>

<p>The pain ceased, and the next instant he discovered
what had caused it. His binoculars had
been laid upon a rock, one of a few that cropped
out here and there in the arid sand.</p>

<p>Clearly the Jap and Kenworth had forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to take the glasses with them, for following his
binding Ned had been stripped of everything he
possessed. They lay with the small ends toward
him. The sun streaming through the large lenses
became concentrated into two tiny, burning dots
of white light at the small end of the glasses.</p>

<p>The binoculars had, in fact, become converted
into a burning glass, and the sharp sting on
Ned's hand had been caused by one of the discs
of concentrated heat. Ned was still engaged on
this explanation of his pained hand when there
was borne to his nostrils the sharp, acrid odor
of burning cloth.</p>

<p>He realized in a flash what had happened.
When he rolled over, the disc of burning essence
of light had left his hand, but centered itself on
some portion of his garments. The cloth was on
fire and was smoldering.</p>

<p>He was powerless to feel with his hands where
the cloth had ignited and could feel as yet no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
pain. But the odor of the burning fabric was
unmistakable.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, but it was not until some
seconds later that Ned realized, with a thrill of
horror, what that odor of burning cloth really
meant.</p>

<p>If he could not extinguish that slowly consuming
fire, it might presently burst into flame.
Powerless to save himself, he would be burned
alive!</p>

<p>For an instant he felt sick and faint. Then
he rallied his faculties and began to roll over
and over in the sand. After some moments of
this, the odor of burning ceased.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven for that," thought the boy
with a shudder, as he sensed his terribly narrow
escape.</p>

<p>Suddenly his heart gave an exultant throb.
A glad thought had been born in his mind. From
whence the inspiration came, he did not know.
It was enough that it had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>If the rays of the binoculars that had been
so providentially placed would ignite cloth, they
would surely set fire to rope!</p>

<p>Ned rolled over once more till he could settle
the tiny burning spot upon his wrist bonds. It
was tedious work, and by the time he had the
white hot circlet focused on the ropes, his hands
were covered with tiny red burns that stung like
hornets.</p>

<p>But in the excitement of the moment he
scarcely paid any attention to these. With shining
eyes he watched the rope begin to smoke. It
glowed red. The air was filled with a pungent
odor.</p>

<p>Ned gave a quick wrench. Like burned flax
the charred and smoldering wrist gyves gave
way. With his hands free, Ned sat up. He felt
sick and dizzy, but his heart bounded with overflowing
gratitude. He cast the burning ropes
far from him.</p>

<p>A jagged clam shell lay not far off. He made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
his way to it, half rolling and half staggering.
Then, with the sharp shell edges he swiftly cut
his leg bonds.</p>

<p>He found himself shaking all over. There
was an odd swimming feeling in his head. The
sand about him flashed red as blood and the sun
reeled through it like a blazing ball of copper.</p>

<p>He spat the gag out of his mouth as the fit of
weakness passed from him.</p>

<p>"Now," he said half aloud, as he rose on his
aching ankles, "now to try conclusions with two
of the vilest traitors it has ever been my ill fortune
to encounter."</p>

<p>He stood thus a moment looking about him.
Then, with painful footsteps, for his circulation
was not yet fully restored, he set off along the
Neck to where the squat, grim pile of dull red
buildings marked the location of the fort.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SURPRISES.</p>


<p>"Halt!"</p>

<p>The command came like the crack of a pistol.
Facing Ned stood a sentry in the uniform of the
Coast Artillery. In his hands he gripped a carbine
with a sinister-looking, blue-steel bayonet
attached to its barrel.</p>

<p>"Here's where you turn back, friend, and
<i>pronto</i>, too," grinned the sentry. He was a
young fellow, with light blue eyes, stupid in expression,
and a nose of the type generally described
as "pug."</p>

<p>"I've got to get to the fort, I tell you," protested
Ned.</p>

<p>His voice came from his parched throat like
the cracked, whistling accents of a very old man.
His clothes were torn in places from the beach
plums, through which he had come with furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
haste, his eyes were red-rimmed and wild, and
his hat was gone.</p>

<p>The sentry regarded him contemptuously. But
his was a lonely post, a quarter of a mile out on
the sandy Neck, and he decided to waste a little
time with this peculiar stranger.</p>

<p>"Say, friend, you don't want the fort. It's
your cage you want. Why don't you go right
back to the Bronx, climb in, and shut the gate?"</p>

<p>"Look here," protested Ned, "I'm Lieutenant
Strong of the Navy, at least I hold that temporary
commission. I've been attacked by rascals
while on duty and I'm suffering frightfully from
thirst."</p>

<p>"I guess you are suffering from <i>thirst</i>,"
grinned the sentry. "Be a good boy and get
back to the bug-house now, or I'll have to help
you."</p>

<p>He glanced significantly at his bayonet.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! Do you think I'm crazy!" cried
poor Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think it?" the sentry raised his thin, pale eyebrows,
"I know it, old pal. Run along and
roll your hoop now, and don't give me no more
trouble. If I was to let you into the fort, I'd
be put in the guard-house for a month for letting
a crank through."</p>

<p>"But I'm Lieutenant Strong, I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentry interrupted by tapping his forehead.</p>

<p>"Sure you are. That's all right. You can be
the President if you like; it's none of my funeral."</p>

<p>There was a sort of soothing intonation in his
voice, as if he were trying to quiet a fractious
child. The stupidity of the fellow almost drove
Ned wild.</p>

<p>He plunged a hand into his pocket. He would
show the fellow by documents that he was not
an impostor.</p>

<p>"I'll show you papers that will prove who I
am," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden chill of horror, he recollected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that all his papers&mdash;none of them, luckily,
very important ones&mdash;had been taken from him
by Saki and Kenworth. The sentry was watching
him, as he frantically searched, with an
amused expression.</p>

<p>"Say, what kind of a game are you trying to
work, Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"It's not a game, I tell you," cried Ned furiously.
"Those rascals who tied me took my
papers. They have run off with them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess it's you that have run off from your
keepers," said the sentry, nodding his head sententiously.</p>

<p>It was hopeless. Even Ned, sore pressed as
he was, saw that. The man was convinced that
he was a crank or a crazy man of some sort and
would have no dealings with him. Ned spied a
canteen hung round the man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"At least, you'll give me a drink," he almost
begged, so keen was his need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"It ain't the sort of drink you want. Nothing
but water," said the artilleryman.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, man, that's what I want!"
rasped Ned through his parched lips. "Give me
just a little. Then I'll go."</p>

<p>"Well, if that's all, drink hearty," said the
man, in more friendly tones.</p>

<p>He cast a look behind him to make sure he
was not observed, and then, unslinging his canteen,
he passed it to Ned. The water was warm
and tasted leathery, but to Ned it was unspeakably
delicious. He threw back his head and let
it stream over his parched palate and down his
cracked throat.</p>

<p>"Cracky! I can hear it sizzle!" exclaimed the
sentry. "Go on, take it all if you need it as
badly as that. I ain't that thirsty, and besides
I'll be relieved in a short time."</p>

<p>Ned needed no second invitation. He drained
the canteen to the last drop.</p>

<p>"I'm ever so much obliged to you," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
turning away; "maybe some day I'll be able to
reward you with more than thanks."</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied the sentry heartily.
"I hope you'll get over that bug of yours about
being a lootenant. Why, friend, you might be an
orficer in Coxey's army, but I guess that's the
only branch of the service you ever had any dealings
with."</p>

<p>Ned said nothing in reply, but with a wave
of his hand walked off. He had plenty of opportunity,
as he plodded along the Neck, for
philosophical reflections on the part that clothes
play in this world. Had he worn his uniform,
he could have marched past the sentry without
question. But, as it was, the man more than
suspected him of being an escaped lunatic.</p>

<p>Ned's intention in going to the fort had been
to establish instant communication with the
authorities and warn them to look out for Kenworth
and Saki. Of course, the fort was technically
the enemy's country, but the lad rightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
deemed that the capture of two such renegades as
the Jap and the midshipman took precedence of
every other consideration.</p>

<p>Now, as he made his way back over the shifting
sands, his mind was busy revolving plans
for the arrest of the two who had served him
in such rascally fashion.</p>

<p>Musing thus, he was pressing steadily on,
when, on topping a rise, he came in sight of a
small, sandy cove. Drawn well up into it was a
sharp-bowed motor boat. A long engine hood
forward showed that she carried powerful engines.
On shore, beside her, lay a figure dozing
in the shade. The tide rippled pleasantly and
the sand alongside the beached craft afforded a
cool resting place.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" exclaimed Ned. "Goodness
knows how long it would take me to walk to
Civic Island. Some time, anyhow, even if I felt
in the humor to do it. I'm pretty sure those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
rascals must have made for there, and if I hurry
up I might catch them yet."</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" he hailed, running down the
bank to where the man lay. "Can you start your
motor on the jump? I'm in a big hurry and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the sound of a voice the dozing man rolled
over.</p>

<p>Right then Ned experienced the surprise of his
life. The man was Saki!</p>

<p>The shock of this discovery had hardly had
time to sink in, and the two were still staring at
each other, when from the boat came another
voice.</p>

<p>"If you're in a big hurry, come right aboard
and save us the trouble of fetching you."</p>

<p>Ned looked up from Saki and faced Kenworth.
The renegade midshipman was regarding him
with a sardonic grin. Ned saw that he held a
revolver. The weapon was pointed straight at
the Dreadnought Boy's heart.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">OFF FOR A CRUISE.</p>


<p>Kenworth had a look of triumph on his face.
While Ned, dumbfounded at the turn events had
taken, faced him, Saki sprang to his feet and
also jerked out a pistol.</p>

<p>"I advise you not to run, my honorable capitan,
or to make resistance," said the Jap, smiling
amiably. "It would not by any means suit our
purposes to have you get away just now. We
must, therefore, claim you as our guest."</p>

<p>Ned feigned an indifference he was far indeed
from feeling.</p>

<p>"It seems that rascals do have all the luck on
their side sometimes, doesn't it?" he said.</p>

<p>The Jap did not reply. Instead, he turned to
Kenworth, who was still standing on board the
motor boat and keeping Ned relentlessly covered
with his pistol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put over that gangplank," he said. "We are
to have the honor of an unexpected visit from
clever Mr. Strong. I cannot imagine how he
managed to free himself, but it is greatly to our
advantage that, after having done so, he took
the path that he did. Now, my honorable sir, if
you will give yourself the great trouble to walk
up that plank I shall be your most obedient servant.
Remember I am close behind you, and if
you should feel tempted to jump or run, pray
recollect that I am excessively nervous, and in
my excitement I might press this trigger."</p>

<p>"You mean you would do so," returned Ned.
"I know you and your breed."</p>

<p>"Complimentary, is he not?" grinned the Jap,
addressing Kenworth.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what he is," was the
grumbling rejoinder, "we've got him tight this
time, and by hookey, I mean to keep him safe
and sound."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there must be no more promenades,
honorable Ned," chuckled the Jap.</p>

<p>Ned could have throttled the grinning rascal
then and there. But he reflected that to make
any break to escape would probably result in
serious consequences for himself. It was a lonely
part of the Neck and concealed from the view
of the little-traveled path that led through the
brush.</p>

<p>Besides, he thought that possibly another
chance to get away might present itself. If he
proved troublesome, the two rascals would take
double pains to secure him, whereas if they
thought he was thoroughly subdued they might
not be so particular.</p>

<p>With this thought in mind, he threw back his
head proudly and walked across the rickety gangway
with a firm step.</p>

<p>"At least, I won't let them see that they can
scare a sailor of Uncle Sam's," he thought, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
defiantly into the grimacing face of Kenworth.</p>

<p>As soon as he was on board, the gangplank
was drawn in. Then Saki addressed the involuntary
guest.</p>

<p>"Hold out your hands, please, honorable sir."</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded Ned, although he
guessed what was coming. They were going to
bind him again.</p>

<p>But this time Ned guessed wrong. That is,
on the present occasion the two worthies had
clearly decided to use no ordinary methods of
insuring the safety of their prisoner.</p>

<p>"I wish to present you with some jewelry,"
said Saki, with a grin that made Ned wild to
give the oily, grimacing ruffian a good drubbing.</p>

<p>The next instant he produced a pair of handcuffs.
Ned, situated as he was, had no choice
but to submit to being manacled.</p>

<p>"It's what I might have expected of you," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
said, as Saki snapped the locks shut. "May I
ask what you mean to do with me?"</p>

<p>"We will take a little cruise out into open
water till it gets dark, and then we shall return
to&mdash;to&mdash;well, we shall return you to a safe place
on shore for the night."</p>

<p>As the Jap spoke, Kenworth started the engine
and then drew in the anchor. The clutch was
slipped into forward speed and the motor boat
moved out of the little cove, splitting the water
at a good rate.</p>

<p>"You said you were going to take a cruise?"
inquired Ned.</p>

<p>"Such is our intention," rejoined Kenworth,
who had the wheel, with a scowl.</p>

<p>"I should advise you not to," was the quiet
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>For answer Ned pointed to great castellated
clouds piled up in majestic masses on the horizon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
They towered whitely against the blue sky and
appeared to be traveling at some speed.</p>

<p>"Well, what about those clouds?" asked Kenworth,
with his customary sneer.</p>

<p>"Thunder heads. We are in for a bad storm,
or I miss my guess," said Ned, in the same quiet
tones.</p>

<p>"Hark at the scare-cat!" chuckled Kenworth.
"Say, Ned Strong, for a braggart upstart you
show the white feather mighty soon."</p>

<p>"If only you were concerned," retorted Ned,
"I shouldn't care what became of this craft or
those in it. But I'd hate to be drowned, when
some day I confidently expect to be the means of
bringing you two traitors to justice."</p>

<p>It was perhaps an unwise speech, but Ned was
mad clear through. Kenworth looked at him
keenly.</p>

<p>"So that's your little plan, eh?" he asked.
"Well, I guess we know ways to checkmate that,
Saki."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," responded the Jap, gravely
nodding his head.</p>

<p>"That's all I have to say," said Ned; "go
ahead and work out your own salvation. I've
warned you."</p>

<p>"I always knew you were a coward at bottom,
Strong," scoffed Kenworth, "and now I'm going
to give you a cruise that will take the starch out
of you for the rest of your life."</p>

<p>He touched the control, which was on the
steering wheel like that of an automobile. The
craft leaped forward like a flying fish. The spray
flew high on either bow. Kenworth, a wicked
gleam in his eyes, headed straight up the Sound.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE STORM.</p>


<p>As Ned had foreseen, a storm was brewing.
It was one of those sudden summer storms that
come up almost without warning and rage furiously
over the Sound. The big thunder heads
rolled up rapidly till the entire sky was overcast.</p>

<p>Saki was sitting on the stern seat. Ned, with
a gleam of satisfaction, saw that the Jap looked
frightened. Indeed the weather promised to be
bad enough to alarm even an experienced sailor,
which Saki surely was not.</p>

<p>Under the dark clouds the sky was shot with
an angry, lurid, copper color. The sea had
turned leaden and began to heave suddenly.
Still Kenworth, driven by his hatred of Ned,
kept on.</p>

<p>It appeared that he hardly cared what became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of himself or his companion, so that he could
have his revenge upon Ned. As a matter of
fact, Kenworth by no means liked the looks of
the weather himself. But it would have been
unsafe to remain ashore with Ned, as neither the
midshipman nor Saki knew with whom he had
been conversing during his brief liberty. For all
they could tell, although it did not appear probable,
an ambush might have been laid for them.
Therefore, they had decided to cruise about till
it grew dark.</p>

<p>Ned, for his part, determined to say nothing
more. He sat on a midship seat, the handcuffs
on his wrists, watching the coming storm.</p>

<p>The wind began to moan in an eerie sort of
way. It sounded like the actual voice of the
coming tempest. The sea began to whip up into
white caps. Suddenly the black storm curtain
was ripped and rent from top to bottom by a
jagged streak of livid lightning.</p>

<p>Saki turned a sort of pasty green. His knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
almost knocked together. The motor boat was
a narrow-waisted, wasp-like craft, and did not
appear to be suited for heavy weather.</p>

<p>"Maybe so we better go back," suggested the
Jap in a shaky voice. He glanced apprehensively
at the mighty canopy of the storm overhead.</p>

<p>Kenworth turned on him almost savagely.</p>

<p>"We'll go back when I get good and ready,"
he said. "I want to see how much this white-livered
braggart can stand. Yes, I mean you,
Strong."</p>

<p>There was a sweeping blast of wind. It was
followed by a blinding flash and then a roar like
the rumble of a million celestial chariot wheels.
The Jap hid his face while the lightning seared
and streaked the sky as if an egg had been spattered
to smithereens on a blackboard. The very
air smelled sulphurous.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess we'll go back," said Kenworth.</p>

<p>Just then a wave struck the side of the bow
and reared its white crest high above the tossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
craft. Saki sprang to his feet as the salt water
came dousing down in a regular cloudburst. It
drenched Kenworth to the skin and tore from
the Jap a frightened shout.</p>

<p>"Hope you like it," grinned Ned, the only collected
person on the boat. The dark frenzy of
Kenworth's mad passion had passed and now he
saw with panic-stricken eyes the danger they
were in. The wind was howling furiously and
the waves were piling up on every side. It
seemed impossible that the lightly built craft
could live much longer in the tumult of waters.</p>

<p>Saki was in a panic of fear. Crouched on
the bottom of the boat, his yellow face looked,
in the glare of the almost incessant lightning,
like some hideous war-mask of the old Samurai.</p>

<p>Ned gazed about him. The outlook was bad,
very bad. And then there were those handcuffs.
If only he could get them off. He addressed the
terrified Saki.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/03large.jpg"><img src="images/03.jpg" width="400" height="577" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">"You drop that wheel, and we'll all go to Davy Jones!"
shouted Ned.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_155">Page 155</a></i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, you, take these handcuffs off. At once,
do you hear me?"</p>

<p>He felt no fear of the groveling wretch at his
feet. He even emphasized his remarks by a
threatening gesture of his foot.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Honorable Saki much frightened!"
wailed the Jap.</p>

<p>"You contemptible yellow cur," snapped Ned,
"brace up! Do you hear me? Come now, quick,
the key."</p>

<p>The Jap actually managed to struggle to his
feet and produce the key. Kenworth saw what
he was doing.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" he yelled, and began to let go of
the wheel. A shout from Ned brought him to
his senses.</p>

<p>"You drop that wheel, and we'll all go to Davy
Jones!" shouted Ned.</p>

<p>Kenworth gripped the spokes again. If ever
fear was written on a face, it was on his. The
thought of the death that was so near paralyzed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
him. Perhaps he thought of that other storm
off the Cuban coast when Ned had brought them
safely aboard through a wilder sea than this.</p>

<p>The Jap's teeth chattered as he unfastened the
handcuffs and Ned jerked his hands free.</p>

<p>"Now hand over that gun. Quick, now,"
snapped out Ned.</p>

<p>The Jap was so terrified that he would have
done anything he was told. With hands that
shook, he handed over the pistol. Ned took
possession of it with grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>The chance that he had hoped against hope
might come had arrived. He was on even terms
with his foes. But would that fact do him any
good? The storm was raging so furiously that
Ned, with all his optimism, could not hope that
the motor craft would live through it.</p>

<p>The only thing to be done, as he saw it, was
to run for the lee of a point of land some distance
off. If they could reach this in safety, they
might have a chance. If not, and the storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
continued to increase in violence, there was
hardly one chance in a thousand for them.</p>

<p>The angry lightning hissed and crackled and
the thunder boomed with ear-splitting clamor as
Ned made his way forward to Kenworth's side.
When he arrived there, he seized the other by
the shoulder and shouted in his ear.</p>

<p>"Steer for that point yonder! It's the only
chance we've got."</p>

<p>Kenworth, in his fear forgetting everything
but the instinct of self-preservation, obediently
headed the storm-stressed craft around.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that another sea broke
upon the little vessel.</p>

<p>There was a sputter and a series of coughs
from the engine, and simultaneously the motor,
upon which all depended, went dead.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CONFESSION.</p>


<p>"This is the finish!"</p>

<p>Ned gasped out the words as he heard the
last expiring cough of the motor. It was hopelessly
short-circuited. The battery box was
drenched, the spark-plugs dripping.</p>

<p>Kenworth turned a white face on him.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That your wicked schemes have ended in this,
Kenworth&mdash;a miserable death for us all. This
tinder box cannot live more than five minutes
longer, if that. You had best prepare to meet
your Maker."</p>

<p>Kenworth, moaning like the arrant coward he
was, threw himself groveling on the floor of the
boat.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh! Can nothing save us?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
moaned. "Listen, Strong, I have been wicked,
I know. But I was poor, and gambling took away
whatever money I could scrape together. I was
threatened with exposure to my relatives if I
did not pay my debts.</p>

<p>"That would have meant ruin, for, influential
as they were, they had become disgusted with
the poor showing I had made in the navy. It
was at this crisis that I met Saki. He tempted
me to betray naval secrets with promises of
money. He helped me pay my debts and gave
me money lavishly. In return, I furnished him
with every scrap of information I could pick up.
He has secret code books, fire-control plans, night
signals, and details of our ammunition resources."</p>

<p>Ned looked at the wretch that groveled at his
feet as if he could have struck him.</p>

<p>"How long has this been going on?" he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"For a long time. Saki had me in his power.
I was helpless."</p>

<p>"Don't be a weakling in addition to your other
faults," said Ned imperiously. "Have you that
book of drawings you have been making?"</p>

<p>"Y-y-y-yes."</p>

<p>"Give it to me."</p>

<p>"B-b-b-but it is meant for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give it to me. If I should be saved, I will
see that the proper authorities get it. If not,
there will no harm come of it. Come, hand it
over."</p>

<p>Quivering from head to foot, white-faced and
limp-fingered, Kenworth fumbled in his pockets.
He drew out a book and handed it over to Ned.
The Dreadnought Boy took it and thrust it into
his pocket.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so before a giant wave
swept down on the motor boat. Caught in the
trough of the seas, the craft wallowed helplessly.</p>

<p>Then, half full of water, she sidled down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
other side. Ned saw that the end was at hand.
With a white, set face he ripped out some life
preservers from under the seats.</p>

<p>"Here, put these on," he commanded Kenworth
and the Jap.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he flung one to each. They seized
them, their teeth chattering and their throats
uttering sounds that were hardly human. Ned
took one himself and buckled it on.</p>

<p>"At least the stolen secrets of the United
States Navy are in safe hands now," he muttered;
"if I go to the bottom, there is no better
keeper of confidences than old Davy Jones. If I
should save my life, no power on earth will separate
me from them till I have placed them in the
hands of the naval authorities."</p>

<p>The half-filled boat kept afloat with wonderful
seaworthiness, considering her narrow build.
Wave after wave, that it appeared must engulf
her half water-logged hull, she rode right gallantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned actually began to entertain a ray of hope
that, after all, she might weather the tempest.
But it was still blowing with malignant fury, and
there did not appear to be any sign of abatement
in the huge seas and constant display of angry
lightning.</p>

<p>"D-d-d-do you think she can live?" stammered
Kenworth.</p>

<p>Ned shook his head. He turned a glance of
contempt upon the conscience-stricken coward.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you care for
life after what you have confessed to me?" he
demanded. "Why, Kenworth, if I had done one
half of what you admit, I should not wish ever
to meet one of my fellow men again.</p>

<p>"Why, man, you had a glorious chance in the
finest sea service in the world! What did you
do with it? Chucked it away and became a pawn,
a creature of your country's enemies."</p>

<p>Kenworth whimpered like a whipped cur.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I needed the money," he stuttered; "I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
helpless in the hands of the Jap. I tried to do
better, but somehow I couldn't break away. I&mdash;I
always liked you, Strong. I did indeed. Can
you save us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you liked me so much that on every occasion
you could you took advantage of the fact
that you were an officer to insult and abuse me!
Kenworth, now that you are frightened at the
face of death, you are willing to cringe and cow
to me.</p>

<p>"If we were all to be saved, and our positions
could ever be the same again, you would be just
the same. It is the nature of such men as you.
But we never shall be the same again, Kenworth.
Your career is ended. Driven from the navy,
branded as a traitor, you will find no peace."</p>

<p>"B-b-b-but life is sweet, Strong. Can't you
save us? Saki will give you money. Plenty of
money."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, honorable sir," cried the Jap eagerly.
"My emperor will reward you. I, too, am rich.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
I will give you much money. Only save us.
There is nothing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A scream of terror from Kenworth's white
lips split the air. It sounded above the rumble
of the thunder chariots.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" he shrieked, high above the
noises of the storm.</p>

<p>Towering over them, looming up through the
flying wrack like the tremendous figure of fate
itself, was a gigantic black form. It was right
upon them.</p>

<p>"It's a schooner!" shouted Ned. "She's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a horrible crunching sound and the
motor boat was no more. Severed clean in two,
she sank, the storm-racked sea carrying with
her those who a moment before had been of her
company.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ORDERS ARE ORDERS.</p>


<p>Meantime, on board the <i>Seneca</i>, Herc had been
feeling intense anxiety over the non-return of
Midshipman Kenworth. To add to his uneasiness,
also, Saki, who had been sent ashore to
order some fresh provisions, had not returned.</p>

<p>The crew of the gig had waited for the Jap
that evening (the evening of Ned's departure)
for more than two hours. The village was some
little distance back from the shore and they allowed
him ample time to go and return, considering
the fact that a trolley line connected with the
place.</p>

<p>When he did not return within that time, the
coxswain ordered a return to the ship to receive
further orders from Herc, acting commandant.
Herc, in some perplexity as to the best course to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
pursue, finally decided to order a picket party
to find out what had become of the Oriental.</p>

<p>A thorough search of the village was made
and at length, in a garage, they struck the trail
of the yellow man. It appeared that he had
rented a car there and departed for parts unknown.</p>

<p>Herc decided to wait for the return of the
driver. He felt in a vague yet positive way that
there was more underlying the disappearance of
the Japanese than could be accounted for on the
supposition that he had gone off on an undisciplined
joy ride.</p>

<p>The chauffeur returned at last. He had taken
Saki to a town where the Jap had boarded a
train of the main line of the Long Island Railroad.
That was all he knew. He had been well
paid, he volunteered, and also added that the
Jap had paid him from a roll that "would trip a
greyhound."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now what would the steward of a gunboat
be doing with all that money?" mused Herc.</p>

<p>He pondered for a time the advisability of
trying to follow the trail of the Jap; but reflection
convinced him that this would be useless.</p>

<p>Besides, the fact that he was responsible for
the <i>Seneca</i> would have precluded the idea. He
could not make it an excuse for deserting his
post that he had been in pursuit of a mere steward;
and they had not any actual proof against
Saki to show that he was anything more than a
deserter.</p>

<p>His description was, however, sent out broadcast,
as a renegade from the navy. This done,
Herc, feeling downcast and uneasy, returned to
the ship. He felt depressed. Influences of evil
were at work, he felt sure of it. But the very
indefiniteness of his suspicions made them the
harder to bear.</p>

<p>"At least, I can find out if Saki was lying
about being short of fresh vegetables," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The assistant steward, a negro named after the
ship where he had last served, Tennessee, was
summoned. Herc made an inspection with him
and found his worst suspicions verified. Far
from being short of fresh provisions, the ship's
refrigerators were amply stocked. There was
no shortage anywhere that would justify the decamping
steward's excuse to get ashore.</p>

<p>"Huh! if I'd only had horse sense enough to
do this a while ago," mused Herc gloomily, "that
fellow would have stood no more chance to get
off this ship than a man would have to sell refrigerators
at the North Pole. I'm a fine dunderhead,
I am."</p>

<p>No wireless messages came that night, and
the morning brought no news of Ned. Nor did
Kenworth reappear at the appointed time.</p>

<p>Herc began to be seriously worried. What
could have happened? The survey of the mine
planting operations could not have taken more
than a day. Ned should certainly have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
heard from. The silence and mystery that were
closing in about Herc began to get on his nerves.</p>

<p>Still he attended dutifully to the routine of the
ship, and Trevor, the operator, was under orders
to report to him the instant anything came over
the wireless. So the day wore away and with
nightfall the wireless began to spit and splutter.</p>

<p>What Herc had dreaded had happened. The
flagship was asking for Ned. Herc was in a
terrible quandary. He could not tell a lie and pretend
that Ned was on board or had been heard
from. Yet if he did not shield his comrade in
some way, Ned was almost certain, unless he had
an excellent excuse for his absence, to get into
serious trouble. Even a courtmartial might result.</p>

<p>At length the wireless became imperative.</p>

<p>"If Lieutenant Strong not on board, get in instant
communication with him. Important.&mdash;Dunham."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Try and get the flagship again," Herc ordered.</p>

<p>Trevor bent over his key. For a long time he
kept sending his crackling waves out into space.
But no answer came.</p>

<p>"Can't you get 'em?" demanded Herc impatiently.</p>

<p>The operator shook his head dismally.</p>

<p>"No use trying. The air is full of messages.
They're buzzing like flies round a honey-pot. I'll
try again later on, sir."</p>

<p>Herc began to see that the command of the
<i>Seneca</i> was not going to prove any bed of roses.
Already he was plunged into the middle of a
puzzle to which there appeared to be no key.</p>

<p>Not only had Kenworth and the Jap vanished,
but Ned Strong was not to be found. Yet there
were the orders: "Get in instant communication
with him."</p>

<p>Herc gave a dismal groan. The more he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
thought matters over, the more complicated did
they become.</p>

<p>"By the bald-headed American steer," he
grunted, in the seclusion of his cabin, "this beats
anything I ever tackled. However, orders are
orders and must be obeyed to the letter. I've
got to get into communication with Ned. Just
as if I wouldn't have done that long ago if I'd
had the chance!"</p>

<p>Turning the command of the ship over to one
of the warrant officers, Herc changed into plain
clothes and then summoned the crew of his gig.
He was rowed ashore and sought out the man
from whom Ned had rented the gasoline craft
which took him to Civic Island.</p>

<p>The man could shed no light on the matter,
beyond saying that he had taken Ned to his destination.
A sudden determination came over
Herc.</p>

<p>Ned had, then, arrived at Civic Island. He
must go there at once and take up the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a blind one," he muttered, "but I'll follow
it to the end if it costs me my commission."</p>

<p>Some time later the same gasoline craft that
had conveyed Ned, landed Herc at Civic Island.
It had fought its way alongshore through the
same storm that had brought disaster to Ned.
Despite the idea he had formed of the difficulties
of the task in front of him, Herc did not imagine,
even in his more despondent moments, what a
trail of trouble it was that he had set out upon.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE "TWIN SISTERS."</p>


<p>Ned opened his eyes. His first thought was
that he was in his bunk on the <i>Seneca</i>. But an
instant's glance about at his surroundings soon
dispelled that idea.</p>

<p>He lay on a rough shelf, rather than bunk, on
a pile of dirty blankets. Another frowsy covering
was thrown over him. Above him were
beams and cross planks by which he would have
known, even had it not been for the motion, that
he was on board a vessel of some sort.</p>

<p>The place in which he found himself was
clearly a small cabin. In the center of the forward
bulkhead stood a rusty stove with a high
rail to keep the pots and pans simmering on it
from sliding off under the motion of the ship.</p>

<p>Some sea clothes swung from a line stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
across the ceiling. In a corner, against a locker,
stood some hip boots, above which oil-skin coats
were hung. The place was dirty, stuffy and
smoky to the last degree. The last mentioned
attribute was not improved by the sooty radiance
from a dim lantern swinging from one of the
carlines.</p>

<p>"Where on earth&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;?" muttered Ned,
raising himself on one arm as he made his survey.</p>

<p>And then, like the inrush of the tide, memory
came back.</p>

<p>The storm, the wild ride of the motor boat!
The confession of Kenworth, the yielding of the
note book, and then the last terrible scene when
the immense black mountain that towered above
them for a flash had engulfed and broken them!</p>

<p>Ned felt weak and dizzy. But his mind rapidly
cleared. He had a vague recollection of having
been struck a blow when the motor boat was cut
in half. Beyond that he knew nothing more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Yet he must have been rescued. Determined to
unravel the mystery and also to ascertain if possible
what had become of Kenworth and Saki,
he made an effort to rise.</p>

<p>But he was so weak that it was some moments
after he had made the first attempt that he succeeded.
His coat hung near him on a hook. His
shirt and trousers he had on. His first action,
when he reached for his coat, was to dive into its
pockets in search of the book he had forced from
Kenworth.</p>

<p>He gave an exclamation of satisfaction as he
felt its outlines and drew it forth. It was damp,
but not wet within its covers, for the outside of
the volume that contained so many of Uncle
Sam's secrets was clasped tightly by a strong
rubber band. This had kept the water from
smudging any of the drawings or writing.</p>

<p>But Ned just then did not give much thought
to the book, precious to him though it was. His
main object was to discover just where he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and how he came there. There was a steep little
stairway, or ladder, opposite the stove.</p>

<p>Ned climbed it and found himself on the stern
deck of a small schooner. She was spanking
along, eating her way up against a head breeze
while great clouds of sparkling spray tossed over
her thundering, pounding bow.</p>

<p>Standing beside the wheel was a short, thick-set
man with iron-gray whiskers shot with reddish
hair. He was roughly dressed and a pipe,&mdash;short
and thick like himself,&mdash;was in his mouth.</p>

<p>By his side sat a one-eyed black and white dog,
with one ear cropped and the other hanging down
dejectedly. Forward, Ned saw two men attending
to the jib sheets as the schooner came about
and went away on another tack.</p>

<p>The man at the wheel being too busy in attending
to this maneuver to notice Ned, the
Dreadnought Boy, with the thunder of the
shivering sails in his ears, looked about him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
He instantly recognized their whereabouts. The
schooner was crossing New York Bay.</p>

<p>Looking back he could see the battlemented
spires and domes of the skyscrapers on the lower
end of Manhattan Island, and further up the
East River the spidery outlines of Brooklyn
Bridge. Ferryboats moved rapidly to and from
Staten Island, and close at hand a big tramp was
coming along, making for her dock in the Erie
Basin.</p>

<p>As the rattle and bang of the sails ceased as
they took the wind and the schooner filed off on
the other tack, the thick-set man at the wheel
gave his attention to Ned. So did the dog. It
came sniffing around his ankles growling ominously.</p>

<p>The bearded man removed his pipe.</p>

<p>"Here you, Tops'l, go off on another tack, d'ye
hear? Starboard, hard over!"</p>

<p>The sea-going canine appeared to understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
for it relinquished its scrutiny of Ned and came
over to its master.</p>

<p>"Inter drydock with you, you flea-chawed stepson
of a coyote," grunted the man, and then he
was free to turn his attention to Ned.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he grunted gruffly. "How yer feelin'?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good, thanks," responded Ned. "I
guess it's you I have to thank for saving me
from the Sound last night, for I see by the sun
that its near noon of another day."</p>

<p>"'Tis that. We lost a lot of time down ther
East River. It's gittin' so that tugs clutters up
the river worser nor taxicabs does the streets.
But we come down under sail. No fifteen dollars
down fer me, thank you."</p>

<p>He looked oddly at Ned from under his bushy
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Can you anyways recall jes' what happened
las' night?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>Ned shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've not the least idea," he said. "All I know
is that something cut our motor boat in two and
then everything got dark. By the bump I've
got on my head, I imagine something hit me.
But there were two other men in the boat with
me. Do you know anything about them?"</p>

<p>The bushy brows contracted. The man looked
away, removed his pipe, spat reflectively and then
faced Ned again.</p>

<p>"I don't know nuthin' about nobody but you,"
he said, in the same odd way, and then he returned
to his previous question.</p>

<p>"You don't recklect nuthin' more'n what you
told me?"</p>

<p>"That is absolutely all," rejoined Ned, puzzled
by the man's insistence on this one question.</p>

<p>"Well, then it weren't me as run you down.
I don't want no claim for damages on the <i>Twin
Sisters</i>."</p>

<p>"You won't have any, so far as I'm concerned,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
said Ned, a light beginning to dawn upon him;
"but tell me how you came to pick me up?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the way of it, no deception and
no lies," said the bushy-browed man. "Cap'n
Lemuel Briggs ain't the man to lie. Look at
me. Do I look like a man who would inwent of
malice aforethought a faberrycation?"</p>

<p>"You don't," replied Ned, inwardly thinking
that Captain Briggs did not to any vast extent
measure up to his description of himself.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, matey, you shall have the
truth on it," said Captain Briggs, with a fine open
air. "There ain't a man from here plumb to the
Pearly Gates that could ever accuse me of ex-er-ager-ation.</p>

<p>"Arter we&mdash;that is, arter we seen that other
schooner run yer down, I puts my wheel hard
over. Then I sends a man up in the bow to look
out fer anyone that he could save, me being one
of the most humane skippers that ever used a
handspike on a frisky deckhand. He climbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
down into the bobstay riggin' and the first thing
he catches sight of is you, right under the bow.
He grabs you and we gets you on deck and puts
you to bed, and now here you are up again, bright
and spry, and ready to pay liberal for yer rescue,
I hopes."</p>

<p>Ned looked embarrassed. Although he was
pretty sure that Captain Briggs' schooner, despite
the captain's asseverations to the contrary,
was the one that had run down the motor boat,
he still felt grateful to the man for being the
means of saving his life. But his pocketbook
had been stolen by Kenworth and Saki, no doubt
in the hope that it might contain papers of value.</p>

<p>He was penniless. His embarrassment must
have showed pretty plainly on his face, for Captain
Briggs gave a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"That's all right, matey," he said magnanimously.
"I kin see that you come of good folks
and kin pay well. If you ain't got much with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
you now, you can write me a check or we'll wait
till you can take me to your folks."</p>

<p>"But I haven't any folks here, nor have I a
check-book or any large sums of money anywhere,"
said Ned, perplexed about getting out of
this unforeseen difficulty. "Where are you bound
for?" he added.</p>

<p>The captain looked cunning. He laid his finger
to one side of his pimply, bottle-shaped nose.</p>

<p>"That's a bit of a secret, my lad. But I don't
mind telling you this. It's on the Jersey shore
above Perth Amboy."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Ned relieved, "you put
me ashore in Perth Amboy and I'll send you
whatever money I can raise to any address you
give."</p>

<p>The captain stared at him as if in deep thought.
For a moment he said nothing. Then he found
words.</p>

<p>"Ain't you a nice one ter try yer deceivin' ways
on poor ole Cap'n Briggs?" said he in an injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
tone. "Fellers like you ain't ridin' roun'
in motor boats with no money to do it on. You'll
stay right here with me till you send for a messenger
or telegraft or find some way to have the
money paid right over to me."</p>

<p>"How much do you want?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Three hundred dollars, my lad, and little
enough that is to a young millionaire like you."</p>

<p>"But I couldn't get that much, anyhow,"
gasped Ned.</p>

<p>"Then I'm werry sorry to be obleeged to state
that you'll stay here with me until yer do," responded
Cap'n Briggs.</p>

<p>He cast a cunning glance at Ned from under
his bushy brows out of his bleary, blood-shot
eyes. Then he dived into his pocket and produced
a large flask.</p>

<p>"I won't treat you no ways mean. Have a
drink, matey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't touch the stuff," said Ned, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
began to see a partial reason for the captain's
obstinacy.</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders and took
a long pull. Then, wiping his mouth with the
back of his hand, he replaced the bottle and gave
an order to "Haul sheets and go about once
more."</p>

<p>"Looks like I'm destined to get into tight places
that I can never explain to anyone's satisfaction,"
mournfully muttered Ned to himself, as the little
schooner yawed and pitched and finally clawed
her way round on the other tack.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE TRAIL.</p>


<p>Herc decided to begin his investigation into
Ned's mysterious disappearance by making a
canvass of the hotels on Civic Island. There
were not so very many of them, and by chance
the third or fourth that he struck was the one
in which Ned had put up.</p>

<p>But he could not glean much information there.
They informed him of the hour that Ned had left
the place, and further questioning elicited the
fact that, as we know, Ned had engaged a hack
to convey him part way to his destination.</p>

<p>Armed with this information, Herc, feeling
not at all eased in his mind, started out to find
the hackman. He had a long search for the man,
but at last he discovered him in the person of a
bulbous-nosed, bibulous-looking old specimen of
the genus hack-driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, the man recollected Ned. Knew the very
place he had dropped him. Would he drive Herc
out there? Certainly. Ned jumped into the
rickety old conveyance owned by the bulbous-nosed
man, who rejoiced in the name of Chuck
Chiggins.</p>

<p>Chuck's bony old nag, in due time, landed the
cab at the place where Ned had left it. Herc
could see the Neck stretching out tenuously across
the shining water. Telling Chuck to wait, he
walked about for an hour or more trying rather
vaguely to locate at least some clew to Ned's
whereabouts. Needless almost is it to say, that
he did not succeed in his purpose. In fact it
was more for the sake of doing something to
work off his anxiety that Herc made the idle
search at all.</p>

<p>"The Neck appears ter be gittin' a pop'lar place
lately," volunteered Chuck, when Herc returned.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Herc disinterestedly, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
he resumed his place and told Chuck to drive
back to the island.</p>

<p>"Why, it's jes' this way. Right arter your
friend drove down this way, I meets a Jap pluggin'
along the road. He asks me to drive him to
some point near to the Neck."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Herc had suddenly galvanized
into interest. A Jap! And in the vicinity of the
place where Ned was carrying on his confidential
observations! There was food for thought here.</p>

<p>The old cabby, with a look of astonishment
at Herc's sudden and vehement interest, repeated
his story.</p>

<p>"He were a mighty onery looking Jap, too," he
volunteered; "but, Lord bless yer, if I was ter
inquire into the character of everyone that rode
in this here cab, it's not much business that I'd
be doin'."</p>

<p>As they jogged along over the sandy road,
Herc had plenty of material for reflection. Of
course, it might be only a far-fetched conclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
but it appeared reasonable to suppose that the Jap
whom Chuck had driven was none other than
Saki.</p>

<p>If this was the case, Herc was almost certain
that the Oriental and Kenworth had an appointment
on the Neck. It was not likely, either, that
they were there for any legitimate purpose, inasmuch
as one had deserted from his ship and
the other had overstayed his leave for the purpose.</p>

<p>"I'm certain that their presence there meant
harm to good old Ned," muttered Herc gloomily.
"My! what a tangle this thing is getting into."</p>

<p>The old hack jolted over the bridge and began
traversing the streets of Civic Island. Ordinarily
Herc would have found much to look at. The
Island is one of the most remarkable places in
the vicinity of New York. In summer the inlet
between the island and the main land is crowded
with houseboats and pleasure craft of all kinds.</p>

<p>Its one main street, bordered by gimcrack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
restaurants and rickety boarding-houses, interspersed
with a few stores, is thronged with white-garbed
yachtsmen and girls in brightly colored
blazers and duck skirts. There is music everywhere,
from wheezy orchestrions to wandering
string orchestras. It is a veritable summer city
by the sea. With the first blast of cold weather
the pageant vanishes, and Civic Island is deserted
of its butterfly population almost overnight.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect to life on this remarkable
island. On the side opposite to that
devoted to catering to the summer guests, is a
strange colony of beach-combers, fishermen and
more or less languishing boat-works. In this
part of the island, too, are laid up the gaunt
skeletons of various yachts which have competed
for the America Cup.</p>

<p>Useless for any purpose but that for which
they were built, racing machines pure and simple,
the hulls of the once splendid sailing cracks lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
moldering on ancient ways, dreaming of the days
when they skimmed the seas with pyramids of
snowy canvas rising above their deep-keeled
bodies. In this part of the island can be found
gaunt, rat-haunted factory buildings once devoted
to sail-lofts and rope-walks. But with the
passing of this branch of maritime trade from
Civic Island the rickety structures with gaping
windows and cracking boards stand tenantless
and moss-grown like so many stranded hulks, the
tide washing at the piles on which some of them
extend out over the water.</p>

<p>They were passing along the lower end of the
"summer resort" street of the island when Herc
gave a sudden exclamation. Before Chuck could
utter a word, Herc was out of the rig and bounding
off down the thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The old cabby had not even time to shout out
indignantly that Herc had forgotten the formality
of paying his fare, before the tall, red-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
youth had vanished round a corner, his long legs
going like piston rods.</p>

<p>The cause of Herc's sudden change from the
cab to the street was this:</p>

<p>Rounding the corner, past which he himself
dashed a moment later, he had caught a glimpse
of two backs that appeared strikingly familiar to
him.</p>

<p>Like a flash, the reason for this familiar appearance
had come over him.</p>

<p>The two pedestrians who excited his attention
were Kenworth, the renegade midshipman, and
Saki, the mysterious Jap.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE JAPANESE STORE.</p>


<p>When Herc hit the sidewalk he utterly forgot
all else in his anxiety to follow and trace out the
destination of the two he had so providentially,
he felt, sighted from the cab.</p>

<p>He had a feeling that if he could run them
down without their observing him, he would be
able to discover the whereabouts of Ned, for
the more he pondered it, the more the Dreadnought
Boy felt certain that the two worthies
he was trailing knew what had become of his
chum.</p>

<p>He was perfectly correct in his prompt recognition
of the two men. A second glance as he
cautiously negotiated the corner showed him
that.</p>

<p>The pair, who no doubt felt perfectly secure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
were walking along at a moderate gait. From
time to time they cast sharp glances at some
shabby-looking little shops as if in search of
something.</p>

<p>It will, of course, be recalled that the last time
we saw Saki and his accomplice they were on the
point of being precipitated into the stormy sea,
following the death-blow the schooner had dealt
the frail motor boat.</p>

<p>How they escaped a grave in the tumbling
water rows we shall also learn before long. But
just now let us follow Herc as, slipping in and
out of doorways and taking advantage of every
bit of cover, like a trained detective, he follows
them.</p>

<p>As they did not look back, Herc's task was
rendered considerably more easy of accomplishment
than would otherwise have been the case.
He kept, however, some yards to the rear in order
to guard against the danger of being recognized.</p>

<p>The fact that he was in "mufti" or citizen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
clothes was in his favor. Young Taylor, in his
not very stylish gray suit, was an inconspicuous
person compared with the somewhat swaggering
air he bore when he was in Uncle Sam's uniform.</p>

<p>They were leaving behind them the street that
was crowded with summer-garbed promenaders.
The stores were small and of no attraction.
Dingy, uncleaned windows and slatternly-looking
merchants began to make their appearance.</p>

<p>At the foot of the down-at-heel side street,
Herc could catch a glimpse of water and could
sight the barn-like outlines of some of the deserted
factories already referred to.</p>

<p>"Where in the world can they be bound?" he
found himself wondering.</p>

<p>Could he have known the events of the last
twelve hours, he would also have wondered at
their being there at all. It is not given to everyone
to come as close to the grim scythe of death
and to escape scot-free as Saki and Kenworth
had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>As it happened, Herc was not destined to have
to wait long before his curiosity was, at least in
part, gratified. The two men came to an abrupt
halt in front of a store that was even more dingy
in appearance than its neighbors. Grass was
sprouting through the cracks in the rickety
wooden sidewalk in front of it, and, so far as
Herc could see, from the distance he was obliged
to keep, the establishment bore no outward and
visible sign of the goods for sale within. Yet
its big, dirty window showed that it was a store
of some sort.</p>

<p>Herc dodged into a doorway as the two men
came to a standstill in front of this place. By
peeping cautiously out he was able to ascertain
that they had apparently reached their destination.
At any rate, he saw Saki step up to the
door and open it.</p>

<p>Then the portal swallowed them both, and
Herc was left alone on the solitary by-street.</p>

<p>"Umph, what's the next move?" he muttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to himself. "Looks like it's up to me to do something,
but I'll be keel-hauled if I can think right
now just what that 'something' is."</p>

<p>He paused irresolute. Then suddenly he
came to action. He had decided to cross the
street and reconnoiter from there, where he could
obtain a view of the place the two men he was
tracking had entered.</p>

<p>The maneuver did not take long, and was accomplished
so far as the lad could see, without his
being detected, or indeed the slightest notice being
taken of him. So far, so good. Herc gazed
across the street at the forlorn-looking place the
two men had entered.</p>

<p>It was painted a dirty red, the pigment blistered
and peeling off in big patches as if the structure
was suffering from some sort of unclean leprosy.
A jagged crack ran across the show window,
which was too thickly grimed with dirt to
permit the goods offered within to be displayed
to passers-by, if, indeed, any stock in trade was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
on view. Above the lower floor, the second story
was equally inscrutable. The windows were
veiled like closed eyes, with dark green shades
of a faded hue. Above, came the roof, a steep-pitched,
shingled affair, which surmounted the
house like a battered hat on a shabby man.</p>

<p>"Now what," mused Herc, "now what business
can take a midshipman of Uncle Sam's navy
into such a place in company with a yellow-skinned
deserter of a wardroom steward?"</p>

<p>Although it had not at first attracted his attention,
he now became aware that there was a
name over the door. It was in letters that had
once been gilt but were now almost as black and
faded as the board that bore them.</p>

<p>"H. Nagasaki. Dealer in Cigars and Tobacco,
Candy and Notions," was what Herc read.</p>

<p>"Sounds innocent enough," he said. "I know
that fellow Kenworth is an inveterate cigarette
smoker,&mdash;which accounts for his narrow chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and pasty face,&mdash;and maybe they went in there
to get some."</p>

<p>For an instant or two Herc stood at pause, undetermined
what course to pursue, but eying the
doorway through which the two men had passed.
While he stood thus, hesitant, the figure of another
customer appeared in front of the Japanese
store and passed within.</p>

<p>This gave Herc, situated as he was, a chance
to observe the interior of the place. He saw that
within was a counter and at the further end of
the store a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Up this flight of stairs, Herc glimpsed in the
brief time the door was open the figures of Kenworth
and Saki. They were in the act of ascending
the stairway.</p>

<p>"Now what&mdash;&mdash;?" mused Herc, and then he
stopped short.</p>

<p>A bold thought had sprung unbidden into his
mind. That the tumble-down, blighted store on
the opposite side of the street held the secret of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Ned's whereabouts, Herc felt suddenly convinced.</p>

<p>Acting almost without conscious volition, he
crossed the street, and the next instant boldly
flung open the door of "H. Nagasaki's" place and
passed within.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BOX OF MATCHES.</p>


<p>The change from the bright sunlight without
to the dim and dusty interior of the store was,
at first, almost blinding to Herc. Before entering
he had taken the precaution to pull the front
of his soft hat down over his eyes, for, as will be
recalled, he was wearing civilian clothing. This
did not help to make things clearer to his vision
in the gloom.</p>

<p>His first impression was of a large apartment,
bare of floor and wall, with a set of dusty show
cases placed at one side behind a rickety counter.
It did not look like a store where much business
of the kind it ostensibly catered to was transacted.</p>

<p>All this confirmed Herc's growing suspicions
that the place was conducted as a blind. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
it was nothing more than a haunt for Japanese
spies and those allied with them in their schemes
against Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>A soft voice, a voice with a purring inflection
as silky as that of a cream-fed cat, broke on his
ears.</p>

<p>"What will the gentleman please to 'ave?"</p>

<p>Herc saw that a small, spectacled Japanese had
glided rather than stepped in behind the counter,
and now stood regarding the new customer with
a face that might as well have been a mask for
all the expression it conveyed.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, but Herc, who up to that
moment had acted the part of a bold investigator,
suddenly found himself embarrassed. He struggled
to find an answer to the simple question that
had been put to him. This Jap behind the counter
regarded him with growing suspicion.</p>

<p>"You come in for something&mdash;a cigar, maybe?"
he purred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes,&mdash;give me&mdash;give me a box of
matches," blurted out Herc desperately.</p>

<p>"A box of matches? Veree well."</p>

<p>The Jap turned deftly to the show cases behind
him, and inserting a long fingered hand in
a drawer, drew out the required article. Herc
fumbled in his pocket for the change necessary,
but in so doing he drew out a navy button, cut
from his first uniform, with the small silver.</p>

<p>As he extended a nickel across the counter,
with no very clear idea as to what he was to do
next, he had the misfortune, for so he presently
perceived it to be, to drop this pocket piece.</p>

<p>It fell with a jingling sound and before he
could pick it up, the Jap was out from behind
the counter and had grasped and was extending
it to him.</p>

<p>"A navee button," said he suavely. "The honorable
gentleman is in the service of the so estimable
Uncle Sam?"</p>

<p>There was one thing that Herc could not do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
at no matter what cost, and that was to lie. Yet
he had important reasons for not wishing his
service to become known to the Jap. So he compromised.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a navy button," he said pocketing it.</p>

<p>"Ah; it is a fine service," said the Jap, with a
swift appraising look at Herc, and at the red
hair that showed under his pulled-down hat. "I
often deplore that I am Japanese and so cannot
to enter it."</p>

<p>"Yet there are Japs in the navy," said Herc,
and then with one of those incautious bursts
which Ned so often deprecated, he rushed on,
"one came in here just now,&mdash;Saki, do you know
him?"</p>

<p>From behind the spectacles a swift look of
comprehension flashed into the Jap's eyes, and
then died out again like a suddenly extinguished
fire.</p>

<p>"Saki? I no know heem," he said.</p>

<p>"Humph, I <i>am</i> on the right trail," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Herc to himself. "This fellow knows all about
Ned. I'm afraid, also, that he is suspicious of
me, but that can't be helped now."</p>

<p>"If you will wait one minute, I will bring you
change," came the silky voice of the Jap.
"Matches are one penny, you give me one nickel."</p>

<p>"All right, get the change. I'll wait for you,"
said Herc, trying to mask his anxiety to penetrate
the secrets of this place under an appearance of
indifference.</p>

<p>The Jap, with one swift backward glance at
Herc, glided off and up the same stairway that
Herc had seen Saki and Kenworth ascend. So
he was going to join them and doubtless tell them
of his suspicions. Herc was in a quandary.</p>

<p>If he left the place to give the alarm to the
authorities, by the time he came back the birds
might have flown and with them all clew to Ned.
On the other hand, he could not, single-handed,
face the whole nest of them.</p>

<p>But the next instant came another thought.
After all, the place was not on the outposts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
civilization. It was policed just as any other
well-ordered district. Not a block away were
gay summer cafés and promenaders. What
harm could come to him here?</p>

<p>It was while his mind was busied with these
reflections that Herc's eye fell on the door at the
end of the store, already mentioned.</p>

<p>Where did it lead to? Perhaps to Ned's prison
place. Herc glanced about him. The store was
empty. Outside someone passed along whistling
gaily. After all, he had nothing to fear and all
to gain, if he could ascertain something concerning
Ned's fate.</p>

<p>With half a dozen swift strides, Herc was
across the store and at the rear door.</p>

<p>He fumbled with the latch an instant and then
the portal swung open. Beyond was a dark passage.
This rather surprised Herc, who had surmised
that the door gave on to a back yard or
another street, and who had thought that in case
of emergency it might be utilized as a means of
escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this moment that a murmur of voices
reached his ears. Several persons were seemingly
descending the stairway up which the spectacled
Jap had passed to procure change.</p>

<p>Herc was about to dart for the front door
when he heard a sudden sharp clicking sound.</p>

<p>As if by intuition he guessed what it meant.
By some mechanical means a bolt had been shot
and he was trapped. He sped back again to the
rear door. Darting through it, he dashed into
the dark passage beyond. Then he suddenly
checked himself. Why not secure that rear door
from the inside?</p>

<p>But a second's fumbling in the dark showed
him that there was no means of doing this.</p>

<p>The voices grew louder. They swelled to an
angry clamor. Herc hastily slammed the door
and plunged forward into the blackness. As he
ran, he heard the trample of feet behind him
and knew that the hunt was up and that he was
the quarry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MYSTERIES.</p>


<p>All that day, against head winds and tides,
Captain Briggs' schooner clawed her way around
Staten Island. Nightfall found her making her
way up the staked channel in Raritan Bay with a
fair breeze, and the bibulous skipper was in good
humor. He even condescended to joke and laugh
with Ned, who stood glumly by the wheel, watching
the clumsy handling of the broad-beamed old
craft.</p>

<p>Ned had indulged in much speculation concerning
Captain Briggs and his craft since he
had become what he felt was virtually a prisoner
on board her. He was puzzled to make out the
vessel's mission. Captain Briggs waxed more
and more mysterious as the contents of the bottle
and the sun together grew lower. From time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
to time he threw out hints, which only served
the purpose of further mystification.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy began to think that he
was on board a smuggler. It was the only conclusion
he could reach, although he was actually
miles beside the mark in his guess.</p>

<p>As it grew dusk, the schooner was brought up
opposite a sandy, desolate-looking stretch of
ground on the Jersey shore. It was a brush-grown
point with here and there steep, reddish-colored
miniature cliffs, where landslides had occurred
in the sandy earth.</p>

<p>On the summit of the point a tall, white semaphore,
like some grotesque skeleton, spread its
arms against the sky. A chill wind blew off
shore. Ned felt that he had reached the last
spot in civilization, even though off in the distance
on the Staten Island shore the smoke from
the factory chimneys of Tottenville could be seen
like a dark and sooty pall.</p>

<p>Ned was wondering whether they were going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
to anchor there, when his unspoken question was
answered by the rattle of the schooner's hawser
as the rusty mud-hook dropped into the yellow,
turbid tide.</p>

<p>"Well, of all queer cruises, this is the queerest,"
mused Ned, as he leaned against the rail
and watched Captain Briggs bringing his craft
to an anchorage.</p>

<p>He could not forbear smiling at the captain's
importance as he issued his orders. A rear admiral
on his own quarter-deck could not have
been a bit more pompous or consequential.</p>

<p>At last all was arranged to Captain Briggs'
satisfaction, and the schooner, under bare poles,
swung at anchor.</p>

<p>"What's coming now?" wondered Ned, as he
saw the captain come sidling toward him like a
red-nosed crab, if such a thing can be imagined.</p>

<p>He was not left long in doubt. The captain
eyed him with an oddly embarrassed air for a
few seconds and then he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seeing as how I'm looking to get a bit of
money out of you, mate," he said at length, with
a sidewise squint out of his red-rimmed eyes,
"maybe what I'm agoin' to do ain't just right.
But," and here the captain strengthened his resolution
with a draft out of his bottle, "but," he
resumed, wiping his lips with the back of his
hand, "what's got to be has got to be, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Ned, with a smile at the
captain's rather obvious logic.</p>

<p>"And that bein' the case, it will be, I reckon?"
pursued the captain with the air of one propounding
a profound question.</p>

<p>Again Ned agreed. This time he signified his
entire understanding of the captain's views by
a nod of his head.</p>

<p>"Well," resumed the skipper, "it's got to be
that you've got to go below, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go below?" repeated Ned indignantly. "See
here, Captain Briggs, don't you think you're
carrying this thing a little far?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dunno as I am, and if I am, why, then, I
dunno as it's any of your clamjamfried business,"
retorted the captain. "You wasn't asked to come
on board this here fine vessel, was yer?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, and as you know I'm more
grateful than I can say to you for saving my
life. But when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain shut Ned off with a wave of his
hand.</p>

<p>"Least said, soonest mended," he remarked.
"You an' me 'ull have our talk 'bout that later
on. Cap'n Briggs, he gets paid fer his salvage,
be it human or 'totherwise. The p'int is this,
you've got to go below."</p>

<p>"But what is your object in confining me in
that stuffy cabin?" objected Ned. "Let me stay
on deck and I'll pledge you my word that I
wouldn't have a chance to escape from you,&mdash;that
is, if you persist in your insane idea that
I have wealthy relatives who will pay handsomely
for my ransom."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tain't ransom, it's a man's rights," objected
Captain Briggs; "but as I said before, tain't no
manner o' use wasting of words. Below I want
yer to go, and below you will go."</p>

<p>"If I refuse?"</p>

<p>"Wa'al," insinuated Captain Briggs, with a
glance at his crew, who, as if they had been
warned in advance, stood watching the scene,
"wa'al, I op-pine t'wouldn't be just healthy like
fer you to refuse. There's a heap of persuasion
in a handspike and plenty of good argument in
a capstan bar."</p>

<p>"What, you would dare to use violence on me?
Maybe two can play at that game."</p>

<p>Ned's eyes flashed; his fists clenched. Yet he
knew that he must control his temper with this
pig-headed old mariner.</p>

<p>"I'll use violence, or anything else I please,
to hev my orders carried out," flared out Captain
Briggs. "Now then, are you going below peaceable
or do we hev ter make yer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious to have me out of
the way?" asked Ned. "What sort of nefarious
business are you in?"</p>

<p>"Ain't in no 'farious business," bellowed the
captain. "I'm an honest man, I am. But I'm on
secret business,&mdash;business of the navy, ef you
must know. Business fer the Blue fleet, as they
calls it, ef you must know. Now will you go
below?"</p>

<p>"Very well, if I must, I must," muttered Ned,
with feigned reluctance, for at that instant he
would not have left Captain Briggs' shabby little
schooner for a king's ransom.</p>

<p>"Business for the Blue fleet." Could it be
that Fate, by ways devious for even that uncertain
goddess, had led his feet into the arcanum
of the Blue fleet's secrets?</p>

<p>As Ned descended the cabin stairs into the
malodorous little cabin, he determined to find out
before he was many hours older the exact meaning
of Captain Briggs' remark.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE WALL.</p>


<p>As Ned's feet sounded on the boards of the
stuffy little cuddy, he heard a sharp "bang" above
him and then the grating of a rusty iron bolt,
as it was shot to, making him a prisoner.</p>

<p>The sound of the grating bolt and the sense
that he was a captive, even though in a sense a
voluntary one, made Ned see "red" for an instant.</p>

<p>"So they couldn't even trust to my word!" he
muttered angrily to himself; and then, "All this
precaution shows that there is something very
out of the ordinary going forward. Something,
too, that unless I miss my guess is in the line
of my commission to find out. Gee whiz, I'd
give a lot to know right now what is at the bottom
of all this how-d'ye-do!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned cast himself down on a transom. For a
time silence reigned on deck. Then he became
aware of a trampling of feet above him and the
sound of hoarse voices hailing.</p>

<p>"Somebody coming alongside," surmised Ned,
with ready apprehension of what was going forward.
"It must be dark by this time. Clearly
whatever their business is, it is such that does
not bear the light of day for its transaction."</p>

<p>The noise on deck continued. Ned scrutinized
his place of captivity for some means of seeing
without its confines. But except for the scuttle
which had been secured, the cabin was without
openings. No port-holes or air vents were visible.</p>

<p>"If only I could see out," he muttered, "that
would help some."</p>

<p>Then came more voices outside. Above them
sounded sharp, authoritative tones.</p>

<p>"By the great bow gun, whoever is giving orders
out there is a man-o'-war's-man!" exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the Dreadnought Boy. "Something <i>is</i> in the
wind in connection with the Blue fleet beyond a
doubt. By hookey, I may be on the verge of
making some discovery which will be invaluable
to our side."</p>

<p>He listened greedily now. His trained ears
had not deceived him. It was a man-o'-war
"steamer" that had glided up to Captain Briggs'
down-at-heel craft. She now lay alongside, while
her crew of Jackies hustled up upon the schooner's
dirty decks and their leader, a petty officer,
greeted Captain Briggs.</p>

<p>"We'll get to work just as soon as you're
ready," grunted Captain Briggs to this individual,
who had introduced himself as Gunner's
Mate Steffens of the destroyer <i>Truxton</i>.</p>

<p>Presently, to Ned in the cabin below, came
the sounds of hurrying action on deck. He
heard the blows of hammers as the battens were
ripped off hatchways and the cargo of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
schooner, whatever it was, lay ready for the
broachers.</p>

<p>There was a partition forward in the cabin,
and Ned guessed that beyond it must lie the
hold with its mysterious contents. He stationed
himself against the bulkhead awaiting developments.</p>

<p>While he stood there listening to the creaking
of blocks and tackles, as apparatus for transferring
the cargo of the schooner to the "steamer"
was in process of rigging, his eye was caught by
a sudden gleam of light.</p>

<p>The cabin was dark, so he the more easily saw
the long, thin slice of radiance that he was not
long in finding out leaked through a longitudinal
crack in the bulkhead, which was of the flimsiest
construction.</p>

<p>Clearly enough, the hold was illuminated by
the cargo broachers and this light filtered
through from it. Ned lost no time in applying an
eye to the crack thus luckily revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood at gaze for a moment or two, his
optic riveted to the crack. Then he started back
with an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Great ginger! Talk about luck! Why, this
is the very thing the commander was anxious to
find out about. I heard him talking it over with
some of the officers. He mentioned it, too, in my
instructions."</p>

<p>Ned applied himself afresh to the crack. He
might have been carved out of stone, so motionless
did he stand there.</p>

<p>In the hold beyond, all was confusion, shouts,
trampling feet and activity.</p>

<p>One after another big boxes and bales were
hoisted out to be lowered into the waiting
steamer. Through his crack Ned overheard
enough to show him that the cargo was being
transferred as fast as was possible under cover
of the night.</p>

<p>As soon as she was filled to her capacity, the
steamer scurried off and then returned again for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
a fresh cargo. From the brevity of these intervals
of absence, Ned was able to argue that
wherever the mysterious cargo was being taken,
that place at least was not very far off.</p>

<p>More than likely it was some spot along the
lonesome shore. In fact, Ned now recalled that
below the skeleton-like semaphore he had noticed
the decaying remnants of what had plainly
enough once been a dock. If it was desired to
land the schooner's cargo in secret, what more
likely spot would offer for the disposal of it than
this abandoned dock on a desolate shore?</p>

<p>Ned had seen enough of what was going forward
in the hold and overheard enough, too, to
convince him of the nature of the cargo that was
being landed.</p>

<p>By a stroke of fortune that seemed almost
miraculous, he had, or he was very much mistaken,
stumbled upon the headquarters of the
Aero division of the Blue fleet.</p>

<p>The cargo of the schooner consisted of supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
brought from the government station at
Newport for the "Flying Squadron." There is
hardly a boy in the land who does not know of
the tremendous importance attached by modern
governments to the aeroplane, or the hydro-aeroplane,
as an adjunct to a battle fleet in time
of war.</p>

<p>Readers of "The Dreadnought Boys on Aero
Service" are aware that Ned was proficient
enough in this branch of the service to realize
at once the importance of the discovery he had
made. He knew, too, that according to reports,
the Blue fleet's main attack was to be made by
war-aeroplanes. It was ignorance of the number
and location of these flying harpies of the
air that had caused the authorities of the Red
fleet much anxiety. To be "technically dynamited"
by a squadron of aeroplanes would result
in almost certain defeat.</p>

<p>Small wonder was it then that Ned's heart
leaped in elation as he realized that he had stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
by sheer good luck upon the information
wanted. But mingled with his delight came a
sobering reflection.</p>

<p>He might have located the Blue's Aero fleet;
but he was hardly in a position to put his knowledge
to much practical use.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HERC'S SUBTERFUGE.</p>


<p>On down the dark passage dashed Herc. As
he sped he extended both hands in front of him.
For all he knew he might be dashing into an
ambush. It was all too plain now that the place
into which he had so cheerfully blundered was
of a sinister character.</p>

<p>Suddenly his finger tips encountered something
solid that the next instant gave way before
them.</p>

<p>A door swung open. Herc found himself in
a large room, cluttered with rusty tools, benches,
and boxes. High on one wall was a window,
through the unwashed panes of which a gray
light sifted wanly into the vacant room beneath.</p>

<p>The room was plainly enough a cul-de-sac.
There was no means of entering or leaving it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
except by the door through which Herc had
come,&mdash;that is, if the lofty window be excepted.</p>

<p>Pantingly the Dreadnought Boy looked about
him. He must have a hiding place and that
quickly. If he was to be of any use to Ned, it
would be the worst thing that could happen if
he, too, were to be made prisoner.</p>

<p>Poor Herc, if he had only known the true state
of affairs! But with his customary impulsiveness
the red-headed boy had followed his nose, and as
not infrequently happened in Herc's affairs, it
had led him into trouble.</p>

<p>"This place must be a perfect nest of Japanese
spies," he mused to himself, as he gazed swiftly
about. "Poor old Ned, they've trapped him and
got him hidden away some place. But they won't
get me so easily!"</p>

<p>He listened an instant. Footsteps were coming
down the passage now.</p>

<p>"They've guessed I came this way. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
they couldn't very well help doing it," thought
Herc.</p>

<p>He glanced up at the window above him.
Would it be possible to escape that way?</p>

<p>With frenzied haste he began pulling a dusty
bench from one corner and flinging upon it the
old boxes with which the room was littered. But
his time was all too short. Herc had to give over
his labors half completed at the nearer approach
of footsteps.</p>

<p>"I've got to hide some place, and that right
quickly," he muttered, glancing about him in
every direction.</p>

<p>Herc darted for the dimmest corner and
crouched behind a large open box that stood
there.</p>

<p>He had just time to squeeze himself back of it
and draw it over him like the shell of a tortoise
when the door was burst open.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men, headed by Kenworth, Saki<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and the spectacled Jap, burst into the room. They
gazed wildly about them.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, he's not here!" gasped out Kenworth.
"The red-headed fox has escaped!"</p>

<p>"Eem-poss-ible," the spectacled Jap informed
him. "There is no way of getting out this room."</p>

<p>"Then he must be here," declared Saki sententiously;
"we must find him. He is one of the
most dangerous enemies we have got. He is even
worse than that Ned Strong, whose body now
lies at the bottom of the Sound, for the meddling
fool that he was."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is drowned and out of the way," rejoined
Kenworth, "and it was we, after all, that
had the good fortune to be picked up by a fishing
boat after drifting about in our life belts for
hours, and to be brought ashore here. And now,
confound it, just when everything looks like
smooth sailing, Mister Red Head has to bob up
and spoil it all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind that now," said Saki briskly,
"he cannot have gone far. We must find him."</p>

<p>"He must be in this room," declared the spectacled
Jap; "he could not get out except&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short, gazing at the pile of boxes
on the rickety bench. They stood right under
the high window.</p>

<p>Kenworth was the first to read his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Could he have escaped that way?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I will ask you another question, honorable
Kenworth," was the reply. "Could he climb?"</p>

<p>"Climb!" repeated the renegade midshipman
with scorn. "Why, man, both those Dreadnought
Boys would go in places that it would
puzzle a cat to find a footing."</p>

<p>"Then there is your answer. He has escaped
by the window."</p>

<p>"Confusion!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he cannot get far."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"That window opens on to a roof."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The roof was once an extension, but now it is
blocked in on all sides by the high walls of abandoned
sail lofts."</p>

<p>"Then if he did get up there, he is a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt."</p>

<p>"Good." The midshipman's face was flushed
with malicious triumph. "He can't escape us
this time. Saki, somebody, help me up, quick.
This time he'll not get away. One Dreadnought
Boy is at the bottom of the Sound. In a few
minutes the other will be our prisoner."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">TABLES TURNED&mdash;TWICE!</p>


<p>Herc, crouched within the stifling confines of
the upturned packing case, heard the recorded
conversation with a sinking heart. After all,
then, he had been mistaken. Ned was not in the
place.</p>

<p>Some casualty of which he had no knowledge
had occurred and in the catastrophe in some way
Ned, his chum, his shipmate, had been drowned.
Right then Herc would not have given a straw
for his own life. The thought that Ned had perished,
beat into his heart like a death knell.</p>

<p>Careless of what the consequences to himself
might be, he was about to declare himself and
trust to his fists to fight his way to liberty, when
he hesitated.</p>

<p>Kenworth, he knew by this time to be a miscreant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and perverter of the truth. Was it not
possible, then, that he had purposely aired the
report of Ned's supposed death in the hope that
he (Herc) might hear him and in a moment of
desperation give himself up?</p>

<p>The theory, based on what the Dreadnought
Boy knew of the renegade midshipman, was at
least tenable. After a moment's reflection Herc,
now that the first shock was over, found himself
unable to entertain the thought of Ned's death.
It was impossible to believe that Ned Strong,
the resourceful, the brave, had perished as Kenworth
had described. If a weakling like the midshipman
had escaped whatever disaster had happened,
it was incredible that Ned had not saved
himself.</p>

<p>"Give me a leg up, Saki,&mdash;quick; I want to be
the first to confront that red-headed idiot."</p>

<p>It was Kenworth speaking again. Herc heard
the others hoist more boxes on the top of his pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
and then came the sound of scrambling feet ascending
the wobbly pyramid.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a sell for them when they find the
roof is empty," chuckled Herc to himself. "I'd
give a whole lot just to see their faces."</p>

<p>But with this reflection came another thought.
When they found the roof tenantless, would they
not make a further search of the room? Undoubtedly,
and once they began turning things
over, one of the first things they would discover
would be Herc.</p>

<p>Under certain conditions Herc's mind worked
quickly. It did so now. A sudden idea flashed
into his head.</p>

<p>In a trice he had slipped out of his box and
stood free. Kenworth had already chinned himself
through the window and Saki was following
him. In the room were only the spectacled Jap,
the white man whom Herc had observed enter
the place earlier, and one or two other Japs and
white men, all hard-looking characters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>As Herc emerged from his box there came a
shout from Kenworth on the roof.</p>

<p>"Confound it all, he's not here!"</p>

<p>"Whoop-ee! No, he isn't; he's right here!
Wow!" Like a human battering ram, Herc
charged at the pile of boxes. Crash! Bang!</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy's broad shoulder struck
the wobbly pedestal like the prow of a battleship.</p>

<p>"Look out for squalls!" he yelled, as the boxes,
in a crashing avalanche, came toppling down.
The uproar was deafening.</p>

<p>Stricken temporarily to immobility by the suddenness
of the whole thing, the spectacled Jap
and the others stood spellbound for an instant
as the red-headed youth, having demolished the
pile of boxes, came charging at them with his bullet
head bent over like a young bull's. As he
rushed ferociously at them Herc gave vent to a
blood curdling yell.</p>

<p>"Wow! Whoop-ee! Stand aside for the human
torpedo!" he bellowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Saki, who had been in the act of clambering
from the boxes through the window when the
box pile collapsed, hung teetering from its ledge
with his feet beating a tattoo on thin air. He
was howling piteously for aid.</p>

<p>But right then things were moving far too
swiftly for anyone to pay the least attention to
the luckless Jap.</p>

<p>Herc's red head struck the spectacled Jap in
the stomach and butted him clean across the
room. He fell jammed into one of the empty
packing cases and remained there, his legs waving
feebly as though imploring help. One of the
hard-looking white men tried to intercept Herc
as he dashed for the door, but at the same instant
he felt as if a tornado had struck him and he,
too, doubled up and went to the floor with a
crash.</p>

<p>From the roof came a loud shout from Kenworth.</p>

<p>"What the dickens&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not need to ask any more. One glance
through the window showed him what was happening
in the room below him: showed him, too,
that he was marooned on the roof even as he
had hoped to find Herc.</p>

<p>"Help me! help me!" howled Saki. "No can
hold on much longer!"</p>

<p>"Confound you, this is all your fault," shouted
Kenworth, beside himself with chagrin. "Hey
there! Kester! Vaux! hold that fellow! Don't
let him get away; it means all our necks in a
halter if you do!"</p>

<p>The two men addressed attempted to seize
Herc. But they might as well have tried to capture
a young hurricane. The red-headed lad's
fighting blood was up. As they tried to intercept
him, he rushed them and catching them both
around the legs, he brought them down in one
grand smash.</p>

<p>As they fell, their heads bumped together with
a noise like a pistol shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more trouble from them," chuckled Herc
gleefully.</p>

<p>The red-headed lad was beginning to enjoy
himself. The Japs who alone were left standing,
were huddled in one corner of the room out of
the way of the "white demon with the head of
flames."</p>

<p>"Any more?" howled Herc gleefully, and went
charging for the door leading into the dark passage.
His plan was made. Once he gained the
front shop, he meant to force his way out to the
street, if possible through the locked portal. If
he could not batter his way out there, he meant
to smash a window and run at top speed for the
authorities.</p>

<p>But as he dashed for the door, there came a
yell of dismay and the noise of a heavy fall behind
him. Kenworth, half through the window,
had been trying to assist Saki. But he lost his
balance just as the weight of the Jap came on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
him, and together he and Saki had come crashing
down to the floor of the room below.</p>

<p>Luckily for them, the two men that Herc had
just attended to lay there and their bodies broke
the force of the fall. Not injured in the least,
owing to this&mdash;for him&mdash;lucky accident, Kenworth
was on his feet again in the wink of an
eyelid.</p>

<p>As Herc's form vanished through the doorway,
he drew a revolver and in the insane fury
of his rage, fired a shot at the Dreadnought
Boy's fleeing form. Herc felt the breeze of the
bullet as it winged past him and buried itself
harmlessly in the wall.</p>

<p>"Blaze away!" he shouted. "In five minutes'
time I'll have the whole boiling of you in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was not completed. In the room
he had left behind him, the spectacled Jap, who
had recovered his wits, had darted for a lever in
the wall. He pulled it toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same instant, Herc felt the floor of the
passage drop from under his feet and found himself
falling, falling, falling into a black void,
while fires and lightnings wheeled and darted
wildly through his confused brain.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN FRESH TERROR.</p>


<p>Herc landed with a crash on something soft
and yielding. For an instant or two he actually
found himself wondering if he had been killed,
but as soon as his rudely jolted senses reasserted
themselves he found that, thanks to the soft substance
he had landed upon, he was not even
sprained.</p>

<p>"Well, here's a nice kettle of fish!" exclaimed
Herc to himself, rubbing his head ruefully. "I'm
a whole lot worse off now than I was before."</p>

<p>He sat up and tried to collect his thoughts.
A moment's reflection placed him pretty well in
possession of the facts as they were. He had
been dashing at top speed down the dark passage
when he suddenly found himself precipitated into
space. There had been no trap-door or opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
in the passage when he came down it before, of
that he was certain; therefore it was plain that
some sort of device must have been operated to
open a pitfall under his feet and prevent his escape.</p>

<p>"The question now is, though, where am I?"
mused Herc.</p>

<p>All about him was velvety blackness, so dark
that it could almost be felt. The air was filled
with an odd kind of musty odor, a damp reek
as of some place infested with fungus growth and
unclean things.</p>

<p>"Some sort of a cellar," thought the lad, "and
it's not likely there's any way out of it but the
way I came. There might be a ladder there, of
course, but I didn't notice it as I came down.
Ouch! what a bump! I'm lucky it didn't break
every bone in my body."</p>

<p>Herc felt in his pockets for his matchbox.
Having found it, he struck a lucifer. By its light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
he made a brief but comprehensive survey of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>He had fallen on a rotting pile of what appeared
to be old sails, or canvas from which sails
were made. From this he judged that the structure
above him must have been at some time occupied
by sail-makers, and that this cellar had
formed a sort of rubbish heap for the refuse of
the place.</p>

<p>For the rest, the lighting of another match
showed him that the cellar was about eighty feet
square and evidently extended under the whole
of the house above. There was no means of
egress, and he could not even see the trap-door
above him through which he had made such a
hasty entrance into the place.</p>

<p>The walls were smooth, and made of some sort
of cement. There was no hope of scaling them,
even had there been anything to gain by such a
proceeding. So far as he could see, Herc was
in as effectual a trap as it would have been possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
to devise. Only a ladder could do him any
good, and so far as obtaining that was concerned,
he felt that he might just as well wish
for anything impossible of attainment.</p>

<p>But Herc was not the sort of lad to give anything
up without making a try to better his condition.
As soon as his head, which had been
sadly shaken in his fall, stopped aching a little,
he got up from the pile of old sails and began
a further examination of the cellar.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck him was that the
floor was very wet. Slimy, slippery mud was
under foot and a green weed grew wherever it
could secure a roothold. His next discovery was
that the walls were marked near to the top of the
cellar by a distinct line.</p>

<p>Above this line their color was the dirty gray
of the cement; but below, it was stained green
as if from the action of water. Herc puzzled a
good deal over this. He could not account for
it by any theory of mere dampness. Just then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
he was far indeed from guessing its true significance.</p>

<p>One thing, however, he was sure of: the cellar
was close to the sea, for the sharp, acrid tang of
the salt water mingled with the damp, decaying
odor of the place, like a healthy, wholesome influence
in a fever-stricken hospital ward.</p>

<p>His survey completed, Herc sank back on his
pile of old sails to think matters over further.
Not that he felt that there was really anything
to be considered, save the fact that he was helpless
and must depend upon outside aid for escaping
from his predicament.</p>

<p>But no outside aid, he knew, was likely to
reach him there. He wondered what was going
to become of him. Since he had taken that
plunge through the suddenly opened trap, he had
heard nothing from above, no trample of feet,
no sound of voices.</p>

<p>Was it possible that those in the house had
deserted it precipitately and had left him there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to perish miserably like a rat in a hole? The
thought chilled the hot blood in his veins and
started the cold perspiration on his forehead.
Herc was no coward, but the thought of facing
death alone in that dark, dank hole might have
unmanned many a sterner soul than he.</p>

<p>In his despair at the thought that he had been
abandoned to his fate, Herc set up shout upon
shout. But after a time he stopped this as being
a useless waste of strength which it behooved
him to husband for he knew not what emergency.
Herc was not a lad given to beating about the
bush. He faced the bald facts as he found them,
and in the present situation he was unable to
discover one crumb of comfort.</p>

<p>Then, too, what Kenworth had said about Ned
kept recurring to his mind with disquieting effect.
He could not bring himself to believe that
Ned was, as the midshipman had said, dead at
the bottom of the Sound; but nevertheless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
idea kept repeating itself over and over in his
mind dishearteningly.</p>

<p>"What a fool I was ever to come in here at
all," he muttered to himself bitterly. "It all
comes of following my nose. Every time I do
it, I land in trouble&mdash;but this is just about the
worst ever. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off short in his half spoken meditations.</p>

<p>A sudden sound had arrested his attention. At
first he could not identify it and then suddenly
he realized what it was. The tinkle of running
water! Water was coming into the cellar from
somewhere.</p>

<p>Ned stretched out his fingers for his matchbox,
which he had placed near to him, and struck
a light. As the lucifer flared up an exclamation
of dismay broke from the Dreadnought Boy's
lips.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!"</p>

<p>Over the floor of the cellar a thin layer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
water, perhaps an inch deep, had spread like a
liquid carpet. It had not yet reached Herc on his
pile of sails, but even while the match burned, he
could see that the water was rising.</p>

<p>Chilled with a nameless dread he struck another
match. This time he saw where the water
was coming from. It was flowing in from an
iron-barred vent near the floor of the place,
which had escaped him on his previous survey.</p>

<p>At the same instant, Herc thought of the green
stain on the cellar walls; that regular line of
demarcation limned with greenish water-weed.</p>

<p>Then like a thunder-clap the hideous truth
burst upon him: The cellar was below the water
level and the water flowing into it was tidal. It
came from the sea and rose till it reached that
regular high-water mark he had noticed on the
cellar wall.</p>

<p>As he realized all this, a shout of terror broke,
despite himself, from Herc's lips. Was this to
be his fate, his destiny, to perish in this dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
hidden place beneath the waters of the incoming
tide?</p>

<p>"Help!" he shouted at the top pitch of his
lungs. "Help!"</p>

<p>But the lapping of the water as it slowly and
remorselessly rose was the only reply to his wild
outburst.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">NED'S ESCAPE.</p>


<p>At length the confusion and uproar in the hold
of Captain Briggs' schooner died away. The
work of unloading the craft was completed.</p>

<p>Ned glanced at his watch. It was close on
midnight. He wondered if now that the schooner
had been emptied of her secret cargo, his hour
of release had come.</p>

<p>But apparently it was no part of Captain
Briggs's plan to set his prisoner at liberty just
then. At any rate, nobody came near Ned.</p>

<p>He felt strangely lonely now that the tumult
had died out, to be succeeded by a death-like stillness.
But after a time, during which he sought
in vain for a lamp to light up the cabin, Ned was
able to distinguish some sounds that broke the
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The sounds were nasal and were in three
keys. In fact, it did not take Ned long to distinguish
in his own mind the loud snoring of Captain
Briggs from the gruntings and snortings of
his crew.</p>

<p>The night was warm and they were plainly
enough taking their rest on deck after the arduous
labors of the night. Inasmuch as the
schooner lay in a lonely cove out of the path of
navigation, it was also evident that Captain
Briggs had not bothered to set a bright watch.</p>

<p>"Now is my chance," thought Ned, "if only I
could figure on some way of getting out of this
coop."</p>

<p>He sat on the transom a while, buried in
thought. He was revolving in his mind the
strange events of the last twenty-four hours and
the possible effect they would have upon his
future.</p>

<p>Well did Ned know that his absence from his
ship must have been noticed by this time. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
wondered what Commander Dunham was thinking.
He speculated, and the thought was not a
pleasant one, on the chances of his being deemed
derelict to his duty, and being supplanted by
someone else.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy knew the iron rules of
the navy, laws as inflexible as those of the Medes
and Persians. He might be deprived of his
temporary commission without even a chance
to explain all that had happened. One thought
cheered him. Come what might, he at least had
safe within his pocket the book of plans by which
Kenworth and Saki set such store.</p>

<p>He hoped that if the worst came to the worst,
the signal service he had rendered his country in
redeeming these from the desperate hands of the
spy and the renegade would at least plead some
extenuation for him.</p>

<p>"Confound that old shell-back of a Briggs,"
growled Ned to himself; "if it hadn't been for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
him I might have been back with my ship by this
time. As it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Briggs' stentorian snore filled in the
pause eloquently. "At any rate," muttered Ned,
"he's safe off in the land of Nod; so, to judge by
the sounds, are his crew. What's the matter
with&mdash;Jove! I'll try it."</p>

<p>He ascended the cabin stairway and began
cautiously to fumble with the fastenings of the
companionway scuttle. He did not dare make
much noise, as, although he was fairly sure that
Captain Briggs was beyond an easy awakening,
yet the risk of rousing him was an imminent one.</p>

<p>Like everything else about Captain Briggs'
schooner, the scuttle, now that Ned came to prove
it, did not appear to be over and above secure.</p>

<p>"I believe that with good luck I can force it
clean off its hinges," murmured Ned as he investigated.</p>

<p>Indeed it seemed so. The door worked about
on its hinges so freely, it showed that those attachments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
were not securely fastened or else, as
was more likely, the wood had rotted about the
screws.</p>

<p>Ned possessed a good stock of patience and
he took plenty of time, working the door about
till it moved easily. Then he placed his shoulder
to it and gave a gentle but strong heave. The
screws drew out of the rotten wood as if they
had been fastened into cheese.</p>

<p>Five minutes after he had first applied his
strength, Ned, feeling like a modern Samson,
lifted off the door of his place of captivity and
was ready to step out on deck.</p>

<p>But first he took a cautious look about him.
There was a bright moon. By its beams Ned
saw that, as he had suspected, Captain Briggs
and his crew, worn out by their night's work,
were sleeping the sleep of the just. They had
turned in "all standing" and lay sprawled on
the deck in any but picturesque attitudes.</p>

<p>"So far, so good," murmured Ned to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
"and the dinghy's out astern, too. Better and
better. I believe that this is going to go through
without a hitch."</p>

<p>He cautiously replaced the hatchway and
stepped boldly out on the deck. Captain Briggs
stirred in his slumbers and growled out some
orders that came to him in his dreams.</p>

<p>"Stand by to go about! Mind sheets and
braces!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"My! but he's going to be a surprised man
when he wakes up!" grinned Ned to himself.
"I'm sorry for his crew; he'll take it out on them,
for I verily believe that the old shell-back thought
I was some boy millionaire and worth at least
a thousand in reward money to him."</p>

<p>But as chance would have it, it was Ned who
was destined to be surprised first.</p>

<p>Hardly had he stepped on deck, when from
forward a squat shape came bounding across
the moonlit decks. Simultaneously a low, angry
growl greeted the Dreadnought Boy's ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great guns! The skipper's dog! I'd clean
forgotten him," exclaimed Ned in dismay.</p>

<p>The dog hesitated a minute, sniffed and then,
with an angry snarl, came bounding on again.</p>

<p>"If I can't silence him, he'll have them all
awake in a minute, and then I'll have a fine hornet's
nest about my ears," muttered Ned.</p>

<p>Ur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r! The dog sprang straight for
Ned's throat. Luckily, the creature was not one
of the barking kind. He plainly preferred action
to noise.</p>

<p>Ned saw him coming. Saw the white flash of
his teeth in the moonlight. Swift as thought he
stooped and picked up a barrel stave which happened
to be lying near his feet.</p>

<p>As the dog was in mid-spring, Ned let fly with
his improvised weapon. Crack! It struck the
dog right across the nose and sent him hurtling
back in a coiled-up ball.</p>

<p>"Jove! I hated to do that, old fellow," cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Ned in a low tone; "but it had to be, and you'll
soon get over it."</p>

<p>The dog lay crouched in a whimpering heap
not far from Captain Briggs' side. Ned dared
not delay longer. With swift, silent strides he
made for the stern, dropped overboard and
landed deftly in the dinghy.</p>

<p>The oars were in it, and to cast off was the
work of an instant only. Then with strong,
noiseless strokes, he pulled toward the shore.
There was not a sound of pursuit from the
schooner and Ned's heart leaped exultingly as
he threw his strength into the oars.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the dinghy's nose scraped
the beach. At precisely the same instant the
bow of Ned's craft was grasped by a pair of
strong hands, and a gruff voice demanded to
know his business.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE ENEMY'S CAMP.</p>


<p>"Whew! Out of the frying pan into the fire!"
was Ned's instant thought.</p>

<p>Facing him in the moonlight was a Jackie in
uniform. He was armed with a carbine and
looked very business-like. He regarded Ned
with no friendly air.</p>

<p>There was good reason for this, from the
man's standpoint, anyway. He had been placed
on guard duty there, and to be surprised after
midnight by a stalwart youth who had sculled
himself ashore in a small dinghy was a suspicious
circumstance.</p>

<p>"Who are you? Give an account of yourself,"
he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"It's all right. I'm on business connected with
the aero camp up above," said Ned glibly, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
use of information he had gained through
the crack in the bulkhead.</p>

<p>"Humph! In the service?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Aero squad."</p>

<p>"How am I to know you are not one of those
newspaper fellows. We've been pestered to death
with them for the last week. Fine thing it
would be if they got hold of the Blue fleet's
secrets and printed them."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't have any fear of me. I'm
not connected with any paper."</p>

<p>"No, now I come to look at you, you appear
like one of Uncle Sam's boys. But where have
you come from?"</p>

<p>"From that schooner out there."</p>

<p>"Oh, the one we unloaded this evening?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea. My business is urgent."</p>

<p>"I should judge so. Everybody's is right now.
The Red fleet is reported moving up on New
York. The aero squadron sails to-morrow.
Maybe we won't give 'em a surprise, eh?"</p>

<p>Ned gave an inward chuckle. This was just
the information he was after.</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll surprise 'em all right, shipmate,"
said he, and struck off up a trail that appeared
to lead over the little point of land. He had to
trust to luck for it being the right one, for he
did not dare disclose his unfamiliarity with the
camp by asking the sentry questions.</p>

<p>But the sentry suddenly halted him. Ned's
heart sank. After all he had been discovered.</p>

<p>The next instant his worst fears were realized.</p>

<p>"You'll have to give me the password, shipmate,"
declared the sentry.</p>

<p>Ned's heart sank into his boots. But suddenly
he gave a glad exclamation, although not
so loud as to attract the sentry's notice. While
listening to the unloading of the cargo, he had
heard the password given out by the petty officer
in charge of the men.</p>

<p>For the moment he had forgotten it, but now it
came suddenly back to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aerolite!" he said confidently.</p>

<p>"Pass on, shipmate, you're all right," declared
the sentry, and Ned, breathing freely once more,
continued on his way.</p>

<p>It was a daring enterprise, this that he had
undertaken of penetrating into the "enemy's"
camp and discovering just the strength of their
aero fleet, and the exact method of attack that
they meant to pursue.</p>

<p>But Ned felt that it was up to him to "make
good." His absence from his ship, he felt might
be open to evil construction by his enemies. If
he returned with the information, he hoped at
least they could not say that whatever had been
his ill luck, he had neglected his duty.</p>

<p>With this thought in mind, Ned kept on along
the trail which wound in eccentric fashion
through brush and tall grass.</p>

<p>"I ought surely to be nearing the camp now,"
he thought at length as the trail, after doubling
and twisting upon itself like a chased rabbit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
brought him out at a point overlooking a little
bay.</p>

<p>And there below him he saw that for which he
was searching. Screened by trees, the tents lay
in orderly rows,&mdash;big, high-walled canvas structures,
housing, so Ned guessed, the aero fleet of
the Blue squadron.</p>

<p>Some little distance out from the shore were
the lights of vessels. After some straining of
his eyes, Ned made the craft out to be a flotilla
of destroyers. They lay there waiting for the
dawn, it appeared, hidden from the prying eyes
of the scribes of the metropolitan papers who
would have given their eyes, almost, to know
the facts which Ned was now learning.</p>

<p>He counted the tents. There were twenty of
them, each housing a flying boat or a naval aeroplane.
Truly a formidable fleet, and one which,
swooping down upon the Reds unexpectedly,
might "technically" blow up the whole squadron
before action could be taken. But now Ned possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
knowledge which would be of incalculable
value to his officers. He could not have felt
more exultant had it been in actual war time.</p>

<p>Standing there, carefully concealed, he made
voluminous mental notes. It was then, and not
till then, that he suddenly realized what in the
haste of his flight he had forgotten: He was
penniless and in the "enemy's" country without
means of rejoining his ship. His delight turned
to ashes. Of what use was all the information
he had acquired if he could not communicate it
to the fleet.</p>

<p>"Bother the luck," exclaimed Ned. "What on
earth am I to do?"</p>

<p>It was truly a quandary. The camp was located
in a lonely bit of country and it was without
doubt a long walk to the nearest place of
civilization.</p>

<p>"Marooned, and all for the lack of a few dollars!"
groaned Ned. "If only I had some money
along, I might easily get some fisherman to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
me to the nearest town, and once there, I could
get hold of a telegraph wire and send some despatches.
But now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short. His gaze had lighted on
something standing outside one of the tents. It
did not take him long to make out what it was.
The moonlight showed up its butterfly-like outlines
to perfection.</p>

<p>"Great hookey!" muttered Ned, "a flying boat!
If&mdash;if&mdash;I only dared, I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused irresolute a moment, and then,
squaring his shoulders and thrusting out his chin
with his old determined gesture, he strode off
down the hill.</p>

<p>A daring plan had come into Ned's mind and
with his characteristic energy he was proceeding
to act upon it at once.</p>

<p>But it was a scheme so risky, so desperate, that
sanguine as the Dreadnought Boy usually was,
he had to admit that the chances were about five
hundred to one against his putting it through
successfully.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WAITING FOR THE END.</p>


<p>An hour had passed since Herc's despairing
cry had reverberated through the gloomy cellar.</p>

<p>Since his vain appeal for help, the Dreadnought
Boy had sat, sunk in a sort of lethargy,
on the pile of sail. As the water grew higher, he
had mechanically dragged the heap of canvas
closer together, raising it and forming a sort of
island above the rising inundation.</p>

<p>It was the instinct of life fighting against despair,
for that he could ever escape from his
prison Herc had long since deemed an impossibility.</p>

<p>He sat there in the darkness listening to the
lapping of the water against the walls. His head
was sunk in his hands and as the heavy minutes
went by, from time to time he would feel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
water to convince himself that it actually was
rising.</p>

<p>The high water mark on the cellar walls told
him how high the tide usually climbed. Long
before it had reached that mark the water would
be over his head.</p>

<p>It was true that Herc was a first-rate swimmer,
strong of limb and sound of wind. But
what would that avail him, except to prolong his
misery?</p>

<p>Already in prospect he had tasted the bitterness
of the last struggle against the incoming
flood of waters, the battle that grew hourly less
vigorous, and then the final chapter when, too
exhausted to fight longer for his life, the slimy
waters would engulf him.</p>

<p>He wondered dully if they would ever find him.
It seemed hardly likely. Who would dream of
looking for him in that place? Again and again
he reproached himself bitterly for the mad folly
that had led him into such a trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>The fault was his. There was no one else to
blame for it. Had he not acted so hastily on
impulse, all might have been well with him. Too
late he realized that he had accomplished no
useful purpose by penetrating into the haunt of
the spies. It would have been wisdom's part first
to have notified the authorities and then made
his attack on the place.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been a chump and this is what I
get for it," muttered the lad bitterly. "Good old
Ned, I can't believe that he is really dead. I
wonder if he'll ever learn how I ended my life
in this wretched rat-hole of a place. It's a tough
way to die. I wouldn't mind facing death in
battle or in line of duty, but to die like this alone,
in the dark, with the tide water waiting to drag
me down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herc pursued this line of thought no further.
It bade fair to unman him. He felt a desperate
desire to hurl himself against the walls, to shout,
to scream, to do anything to avert his fate. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
he knew that nothing short of a miracle could
save him now.</p>

<p>He struck one of his few remaining matches.
The water was up to his feet!</p>

<p>Herc gave a groan. It was fairly forced from
him. As the match spluttered out, he knew that
before very long he would feel the chilly grasp
of the tide at his knees, then at his waist, and
then as it rose inch by inch, it would engulf him
to his neck.</p>

<p>Then would come the struggle for life, the
hopeless battle against overwhelming odds, and
then&mdash;the end.</p>

<p>Fairly driven wild by these reflections, the
unfortunate lad shouted and raved till his voice
grew hoarse. But there was no answer except
the ripple of the water against the cement walls
and the hollow echo of his shouts as they were
flung back mockingly at him.</p>

<p>He felt a sharp shock as the water whelmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
over his island of canvas. In a few minutes
more it was at his waist.</p>

<p>Herc stood up erect and stepped off his little
pile of canvas, now useless as an isle of safety.
He kindled another match.</p>

<p>The yellow flame sputtered up and showed
him the water all about him. It was knee deep
and appeared to be coming in more rapidly. Over
its surface was spread an oily scum from the
damp floor.</p>

<p>Herc was glad when the match died out. He
determined not to light any more, but to wait
his end with as much courage as he could muster.</p>

<p>"I'll fight it out like a man-o'-war's-man, anyhow,"
he muttered, "but it's tough&mdash;tough to
have to go this way."</p>

<p>The water rose inch by inch as remorselessly
as destiny itself. Herc stood in stoical silence
and felt it creeping up his body till it had reached
his chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Only a few moments more, now, and then&mdash;the
end.</p>

<p>Herc found himself growing strangely calm.
He wondered what they would think on the ship
when he failed to return. If his messmates
would miss him, if Ned was safe and sound and
would ever learn how his shipmate had perished.</p>

<p>The water was up to his chin.</p>

<p>A slight movement on the lad's part and a
tiny wavelet spattered against his mouth. He
tasted the brackish water of the tide. Herc
wished that it would end right then and there.
He felt that it was hardly worth while even to
swim. If he was to drown, he might as well not
resist his fate, but meet it passively.</p>

<p>But the instinct of self-preservation prevails
even among the most pusillanimous. It can turn
a coward into a dangerous foe. Herc struck
out as the water reached his mouth.</p>

<p>He swam easily about, hardly thinking. His
mind felt dulled and bruised. He swam mechanically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
He knew that the end was not far off
now.</p>

<p>And now, in the hope that he might have overlooked
some projection on the walls to which he
might cling, he began feeling along them. But
the cement was smooth as glass, slimy to the
touch, and cold as ice.</p>

<p>Herc began to feel chilled. His limbs felt
heavy. He no longer swam strongly about seeking,
like a cornered rat, for some means of
escape, but allowed himself to float or else tread
water.</p>

<p>Bit by bit his efforts began to grow weaker.
He felt that he could not keep up much longer,
and somehow he did not much care.</p>

<p>It was just at that moment that something
struck him a violent blow under the chin.</p>

<p>It was an old plank. Thrown into the cellar
at some forgotten time, it was floating on the
top of the water and had rocked against the lad
at a critical moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>Herc reached out and grasped it. Somehow
the touch of it was almost as comforting to him
as human companionship. Once more the tide
of life, the desire to live, swelled through his
veins. He was again a fighter.</p>

<p>Supporting himself on the plank, he began to
think. By stretching out his hand he could touch
the ceiling of the cellar.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought flashed into his mind. If
he could locate the trap-door, and it was not
locked, he had a fighting chance for his life.</p>

<p>The thought acted on him like a stimulant.
All his apathy forgotten now, Herc began feeling
about the ceiling of the place. Far from wishing
that the tide would recede, he was now afraid
that it would do so before he had had time to
locate the trap-door.</p>

<p>How he wished that he had a match! It was
terribly tedious work feeling about that ceiling
in the pitchy darkness. The planking above was
rough, too, and Herc was by no means sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
he could distinguish the trap-door when he came
to it.</p>

<p>But at last, after what seemed to be an eternity
of fumbling, his fingers encountered what felt
like the under end of some bolts.</p>

<p>He guessed that he had found the fastenings
of the trap-door at last. Raising himself on his
friendly plank, Herc exerted his strength and
pushed upward.</p>

<p>Sosh! The effort sent him under water. But
he didn't mind that. He was sure that the door
had yielded a little.</p>

<p>The next time he tried, he braced himself on
a supporting ceiling beam by one hand while he
shoved upward with the other. He almost uttered
a shout of joy as he did so.</p>

<p>The door moved!</p>

<p>He inserted his fingers in the crack, and then,
using his head as a lever, he drew himself up
till he could rest his chest on the flooring of the
passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest was easy. Within five minutes, Herc,
dripping wet and chilled to the bone, was standing
in the passage&mdash;safe and sound. As he stood
there, he did not forget to offer up a fervent
prayer of thankfulness to Providence for his deliverance.</p>

<p>He made his way down the passage to the
front shop. It was empty. As he had suspected,
the conspirators, who had made it their headquarters,
had decamped.</p>

<p>On the floor near the door, which had been
left open, Herc spied a scrap of paper. He
picked it up and saw that there was writing upon
it. With some difficulty he deciphered the scrawl:</p>

<p>"Yacht <i>Halcyon</i>. Erie Basin. Thence Panama."</p>

<p>"Now what does that mean?" said Herc to
himself, scratching his head perplexedly. "I
guess I'll keep this, anyhow; it may give the
police a clew."</p>

<p>A few moments later the nattily dressed summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
residents of the island were astonished at
the spectacle of a red-headed youth in dripping
garments hurrying down the main street, inquiring
anxiously the direction of the police station.</p>

<p>When it was found, Herc had a story to tell
that resulted in detectives being scattered broadcast
through the island. But all efforts to locate
the conspirators were unavailing.</p>

<p>They had had a good start and had made the
most of it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Herc made his way to a
wireless station maintained on the island and
secured communication with the gunboat. What
he learned did not decrease his uneasiness on
Ned's account.</p>

<p>The young skipper had not returned and an
officer had been detailed from the fleet to command
the craft. Herc was peremptorily ordered
to report on board the <i>Manhattan</i> at once and
give an account of himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A NEW ASSIGNMENT.</p>


<p>It was the next morning. In Captain Dunham's
cabin on the <i>Manhattan</i>, Herc had just
concluded reciting his story to the commander
and to no less a person than the Secretary of
the Navy.</p>

<p>It had been a badly embarrassed boy who had
at first faced the stern questioning of his commanding
officer; but by degrees, as his story
went on, Captain Dunham's manner relaxed. His
stern air gave place to one of deep interest. And
now, at the conclusion of Herc's narrative, he
spoke:</p>

<p>"I was at first inclined to very grave suspicions
of you, Taylor, but your previous good record
and your manner convince me that you are telling
the truth, more particularly as the department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
has been aware for some time of the existence
of a band of spies who had, in some way,
secured the coöperation of renegades in our navy.
We have been trying through the night to get
some word of Strong; but we have failed. I'm
afraid, my lad, that you must resign yourself
to the inevitable. At any rate, Strong, so far
as we know, died in the pursuit of his duty and
lived up to the best traditions of the navy."</p>

<p>"Then you believe that he is dead, sir?" Herc
blurted out, his freckles showing like scars
against his pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"There is no other conclusion to be reached,
Taylor. His long absence from duty, and the
lack of all word from him, convince me of the
worst. Strong is not the sort of lad to remain
out of touch, if he were in the land of the living.
You may go now, and the Secretary and myself
will talk over the details of rounding up this
gang of miscreants. If they had anything to do
with Strong's death, I will give you the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of taking part in the pursuit and apprehension
of them."</p>

<p>The Secretary broke in.</p>

<p>"That clew that Taylor has in the shape of
that scrap of paper, I regard as valuable, Captain,"
he said. "I would recommend that inquiries
be sent out concerning the yacht <i>Halcyon</i>.
It is quite possible that the conspirators may be
meaning to make good their escape on her. In
that case, if we can trace her, she can be intercepted
at sea and the men apprehended."</p>

<p>"I shall see that it is done, Mr. Secretary.
Taylor, you may carry on and&mdash;&mdash; Well, orderly?"</p>

<p>Captain Dunham looked up inquiringly as his
orderly entered the cabin in some haste, and,
after saluting, stood respectfully at attention.
But it was plain from the man's manner that he
was laboring under some excitement.</p>

<p>"The officer of the deck reports an airship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
coming this way, sir," said the orderly. "He
told me to inform you at once, sir."</p>

<p>"An airship!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, or else a flying boat. We can't
quite make out yet, sir."</p>

<p>"I will come on deck at once. Mr. Secretary,
this may prove interesting. Possibly it is one of
the Blue scouts; if so, I hope to bring the craft
down, 'technically,' of course."</p>

<p>Herc saluted and hastened forward, while the
captain and the Secretary of the Navy emerged
on the deck. The Red fleet lay off Rock Island.
They were awaiting word as to the movements
of the "Blues" before steaming down the Sound
to the attack.</p>

<p>So far, the wireless had been barren of news,
and the movements of the defending squadron
were surrounded with considerable mystery. The
suspense had been wearing, and so every eye
in the squadron, from Dreadnought, battleship,
cruiser, destroyer, and torpedo boat, was centered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
on the strange aeroplane that was flying
toward them.</p>

<p>Opinion was divided as to whether the distant
flying machine was an aerial scout, or was a
friendly craft bearing despatches from a portion
of the squadron which had been sent around on
the Atlantic side.</p>

<p>On came the flying craft, and as it neared the
grim fleet that lay swinging with smoking funnels
at anchor on the blue tide, it was seen to
swerve downward like a swooping fish-hawk.
For a mile or more it skimmed along the surface
of the water and then struck it with a splash.</p>

<p>"A flying boat!" exclaimed Captain Dunham,
who had the binoculars on it.</p>

<p>The craft drove straight on over the water at
a rapid rate of speed. As it drew closer, Captain
Dunham exclaimed in a voice that trembled with
excitement, despite his efforts to control it:</p>

<p>"Great Scott! That's one of our men!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"A man attached to the Red fleet?" asked the
Secretary.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is wig-wagging with his free arm.
It's&mdash;it's&mdash;great Scott! It's Ned Strong, by all
that's wonderful!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was half an hour later, and Ned had told
his story. It was a concise, crisp statement occupying
no more time than was necessary, but embodying
a wonderful amount of important information.
When he came to relate how he had
"appropriated" one of the Blue fleet's aeroplanes
and had flown straight to the <i>Manhattan</i> in it,
the enthusiasm of his hearers knew no bounds.</p>

<p>For the time being, interest in this phase of
his adventures even overtopped the recovery of
the book of plans and coast defences taken from
Kenworth. The book was found to contain full
details of fire-control systems, gun tests, and
other naval data of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>"By Neptune, lad, the United States Navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
owes you a debt of gratitude it can hardly repay,"
exclaimed Captain Dunham, with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall see, however, that the service does
what is in its power to recognize the signal ability
you have displayed, Mr. Strong," remarked
the Secretary.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," responded Ned, with glowing
cheeks, "but the knowledge that I have been
of service to the Flag is in itself reward enough."</p>

<p>"Hardly substantial, however," smiled the Secretary.</p>

<p>A few moments later Ned was dismissed and
joined Herc. Their greeting was not an effusive
one on the surface. Both had been trained in a
school where men are taught to restrain and
control their emotions. But in the hearty handclasp,
and the few spoken words, each friend
recognized the glad emotion that the other was
feeling over their reunion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Later in the day both lads were summoned to
the captain's cabin.</p>

<p>"Here is where we lose our commands," said
Herc, with dismal foreboding.</p>

<p>He was right. Captain Dunham's first words
apprised both boys that they were no longer officers.</p>

<p>"You are relieved of the command of your
gunboat," said the captain crisply; and then, as
the boys' faces fell, despite all their efforts to
maintain "stiff upper lips," he added, "to take
charge of an expedition which will be explained
to you."</p>

<p>The boys longed to exchange glances, but they
stood stiffly at "eyes front." What could be
coming now?</p>

<p>"We have located the yacht <i>Halcyon</i>," said
the Secretary briefly. "The secret service men
have placed us in possession of facts which make
it certain that Saki and the rest are on board
her. She is to sail to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall you not intercept her, sir?" asked Ned,
betrayed by his interest into a breach of naval
etiquette.</p>

<p>"Of course. That will be your duty."</p>

<p>"Our duty, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You are assigned, in virtue of your
commissions, to the command of the <i>Henry</i>, second-class
destroyer. You will intercept and place
under arrest the men on board the <i>Halcyon</i> and
bring the craft back to New York harbor."</p>

<p>"When do we start, sir?"</p>

<p>"At once. The crew of the <i>Henry</i> have been
notified. Steam is up and everything in readiness.
You will, of course, keep in constant communication
by wireless, using the code. When
you overhaul the <i>Halcyon</i>, use no half-way
measures. Arrest everyone on board, seize all
documents and denounce the ship. In particular,
apprehend the man calling himself Saki. He is
in reality Captain Hasamira of the Japanese
Navy and a most dangerous man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"He certainly proved so to these lads," smiled
Captain Dunham. "Now be off with you, boys,
and bring back the men you are going after. We
shall rely on you."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," said both Dreadnought Boys
saluting, though their hearts were in such a wild
tumult that they hardly knew what they were
saying.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE OUTCOME.</p>


<p>In the gray of the next morning the <i>Henry</i>, a
squat, low craft of the destroyer type, with three
fat funnels, lay tossing uneasily on the sweeping
combers of the Atlantic some sixty-two miles
south of Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>She had lain there most of the night, using her
searchlight freely. But no craft answering to
the description of the <i>Halcyon</i> had passed within
her ken.</p>

<p>On the conning tower, Ned and Herc, for the
twentieth time at least, went over the last wireless
they had received from the Secret Service
squad,&mdash;<i>via</i> the <i>Manhattan</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cruise slowly about off Sandy Hook. Sixty-two
miles to the south about. <i>Halcyon</i> should
pass out in early morning. Is painted black, yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
deck houses, two masts, black stack amidships."</p></blockquote>

<p>"It isn't possible that she has slipped by us in
the night, do you think?" exclaimed Herc, gazing
anxiously about at the rolling waste of gray
water.</p>

<p>"Not likely. That despatch came only an hour
ago. If we remain here we are almost bound to
intercept her."</p>

<p>"And if she does slip past us?"</p>

<p>"Then I'll keep after her, if I have to crack
on clear down to the South Pole," said Ned
grimly. "I don't intend to let that gang slip
through my fingers!"</p>

<p>"I've got a few scores to settle myself," cried
Herc. "When I think of that cellar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth and clenched his freckled
fists. It would have fared ill with any of the
gang within reach of his hands at that moment.</p>

<p>"Well, let's go below to breakfast," said Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
presently. "The watch will notify us of anything
unusual."</p>

<p>"Breakfast!" scoffed Herc. "I suppose it will
be the same as supper last night. Business of
eating with one hand while you claw on to a
stanchion with the other. Tell you what, Ned,
these destroyers are too lively a type of craft
for me."</p>

<p>"They're just the type to overhaul those rascals
we're after, and that's good enough for me,"
rejoined Ned. "I wouldn't care if I had to eat
standing on my head just to get a chance at those
fellows."</p>

<p>"'Use no half-way measures,'" said Herc
musingly, repeating the Secretary's instructions.
"I guess we won't, Ned, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, if they should happen to want trouble,
they'll get all that they're looking for," laughed
Ned, as they descended the pitching, swinging
iron ladder that led to the cramped cabin of the
<i>Henry</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>They had had hardly time to down some coffee
and eat some bacon when there came a report
from the bow watch.</p>

<p>"Smoke to the north'ard, sir."</p>

<p>Breakfast was forgotten in a flash. Snatching
up his binoculars, Ned sprang for the iron ladder.
Herc was right at his heels.</p>

<p>On the northern horizon lay a smudge of black
smoke. For some moments it was hard to make
out whether it was receding or coming toward
them. But presently Ned, with a cry of delight,
announced that the stranger was coming due
south.</p>

<p>Not long after, the strange craft swam into
the field of vision of the binoculars. Herc happened
to be holding them on her at that moment.
He gave an exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>"It's a yacht, all right, but not the right one."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"That description. I've got it by heart. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
masts, black funnel. This fellow's got three
masts and a yellow stack."</p>

<p>"Let me have a look at her."</p>

<p>"Go ahead if you want to; you won't see any
more than I've been telling you."</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Herc, after a somewhat long
interval. The yacht had come closer now. She
was being driven hard as they could see by the
constant cloud of black smoke that came rolling
out of her funnel. The crew of the destroyer,
who in some mysterious way had some inkling of
the mission of the <i>Henry</i>, watched the oncoming
yacht with as much interest as their young officers.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of her?" demanded
Herc, repeating his question.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute! I'm studying her."</p>

<p>"Studying her! There's not much to study
over. It's the wrong craft; anyone could see that
with half an eye."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that. She's a funny looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
tub. Do you notice anything odd about her,
Herc?"</p>

<p>"Not I; except that she isn't the craft we are
looking for, confound her."</p>

<p>"Well, there <i>is</i> something queer about her.
Notice that after mast. It doesn't appear to fit,
somehow, and that stern looks funny, too."</p>

<p>"Jove! now that you speak of it, it does look
queer. Say, Ned, you don't think they could
have disguised her, do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I've heard of such things. I
don't want to make any blunder, and yet that
vessel looks to me as if she had been thimble-rigged
in some sort of way."</p>

<p>Midshipman Fuller, junior officer to the Dreadnought
Boys, came on the bridge. Ned turned
to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fuller, what do you make of that yacht
yonder?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"She's a queer looking craft, sir. Looks awkward
by the stern," said the midshipman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just what I think. Mr. Fuller, you will take
the bridge."</p>

<p>"You are going to board her?" demanded
Herc.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's something wrong about her. I
wouldn't dare to take a chance and let her get
by."</p>

<p>"Bully for you," said Herc under his breath.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fuller, please have the boarding launch
lowered with the regular crew. The bow gun
may be uncovered and when I give you the order,
you may fire a shot across that craft's bow. First,
however, I'll signal her to heave to."</p>

<p>The boarding launch referred to was a small
power launch carried amidships on the destroyer.
The sea was rather rough for such a small craft,
but she was staunch, and Ned had no fear but
that she would ride the combers without difficulty.</p>

<p>In obedience to his command, a string of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
brightly colored bunting presently crawled up
the destroyer's military mast.</p>

<p>It was the signal to "heave to."</p>

<p>But the strange yacht showed no inclination
to obey. She kept right on plowing through the
big seas with a crest of foam at her bow.</p>

<p>"You may fire, Mr. Fuller."</p>

<p>Ned's voice was perfectly calm; but Herc could
hardly keep still. The bow rapid-fire gun had
been stripped of its waterproof cover and its
crew was "standing by." The order to fire came
crisply.</p>

<p>"Let her have it across the bows!"</p>

<p>Bang! The gun barked out viciously. They
could see the shot go ricocheting off over the
waves.</p>

<p>But the stranger kept serenely on.</p>

<p>"Give it to her again," ordered Ned.</p>

<p>Bang! Once more a shot whizzed across the
recalcitrant stranger's prow. It struck the water
not more than twenty-five feet ahead of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"Concern 'em, that ought to stop 'em," growled
Herc.</p>

<p>But it didn't. More smoke rolled out of the
yacht's stack. Her speed was increased, if anything.</p>

<p>"I'm certain now that we're on the right track,"
grated out Ned; "no honest craft would ignore
a signal like that."</p>

<p>Then a moment later he turned to Herc.</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor, go below and sight that gun yourself.
Let her have it across the fore-deck. I'll
<i>make</i> them heave to if I have to blow a hole in
them."</p>

<p>Herc was nothing loath. Repressing a grin
in virtue of the dignity of his office, he took
charge of the gun. He pointed it carefully and
as the destroyer rose on the crest of a wave, Ned
gave the command.</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>The next instant an exultant cheer broke from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the excited Jackies. The foremast of the
stranger toppled, and then in a tangled wreck,
came smashing down to the deck.</p>

<p>"Bull's eye!" remarked Herc coolly, flicking a
powder stain off his gloves.</p>

<p>"Stopped her, sir!" exclaimed Midshipman Fuller
an instant later.</p>

<p>He was right. The last "hint" had been too
strong to ignore. The stranger slackened speed
and lay sullenly tossing on the sea.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fuller, sir, take the bridge," ordered Ned,
as he and Herc hastened to board the little power
launch that lay tossing alongside, held off from
crashing against the steel sides of the <i>Henry</i> by
the stalwart arms of its crew.</p>

<p>Tossing like an eggshell, hurled dizzily skyward
and then plunged downward, the dory-shaped
power boat rapidly skimmed the distance
between the destroyer and the yacht. Ned had
ordered "side-arms," and the crew of six was
fully armed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yacht, ahoy!" hailed Ned as they drew near
and a uniformed figure appeared on the yacht's
bridge. "What craft is that?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Spendthrift</i> of New London for New
Orleans," came the reply. "What's the matter
with you navy fellows?"</p>

<p>"You'll soon find out," said Ned grimly. "Lay
alongside, men. Be prepared for a surprise."</p>

<p>An accommodation ladder had been lowered by
order of the man on the bridge, a stout, bearded
individual. Ned was just preparing to climb it,
when there came a warning shout from Herc.
The red-headed lad pulled his chum back just in
time to dodge a heavy iron weight which some
unseen hand had hurled from above.</p>

<p>The weight fell harmlessly into the water.</p>

<p>"It was a Jap threw that; I saw him sneaking
along the deck," cried one of the men.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! We've got the right craft, then!"
cried Herc.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, gentlemen?" demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the man on the bridge. He appeared much agitated.</p>

<p>"The matter is that you will consider yourself
under arrest," cried Ned. "Remain where you
are and order your crew forward."</p>

<p>"You take things with a high hand. Who do
you think we are?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about <i>you</i>; but I know
that this craft is the <i>Halcyon</i> with a faked stern,
a false mizzen-mast and a repainted funnel," retorted
Ned angrily. "I shall hold you responsible
for the behavior of your crew."</p>

<p>The bearded man appeared to be about to collapse.
In a feeble voice they heard him order his
crew forward.</p>

<p>"I call you to witness that this is a chartered
yacht," he cried, "and that I'm obeying your orders.
I don't want to get into trouble with Uncle
Sam."</p>

<p>"I guess you're in pretty bad," muttered Herc
grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>Without further opposition they boarded the
yacht, which there was no longer reason to doubt
was the <i>Halcyon</i>.</p>

<p>As they gained the deck, some figures darted
along it and vanished.</p>

<p>Headed by Ned and Herc, three of the men
dashed after them. The rest were left to guard
the deck.</p>

<p>"That was Kenworth and Saki," gasped Herc
as they rushed down the companionway stairs
and into the main saloon of the yacht.</p>

<p>Ned nodded grimly.</p>

<p>"We've rounded them up at last," he said
drawing his revolver and ordering Herc to do the
same.</p>

<p>Slam!</p>

<p>Just as they gained the saloon, the door of a
stateroom opening from it was banged to. An
instant later came the click of a bolt as it was
shot.</p>

<p>"Open that door, Kenworth," cried Ned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
perfect coolness. "You're at the end of your
rope."</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Ned dodged just in time to avoid a bullet fired
through the panel of the door. Desperate, with
nothing to hope for but a federal prison, Kenworth
was fighting like a cornered rat.</p>

<p>But Ned's voice did not shake, in spite of the
narrowness of his escape, as he addressed the
wretched man within the stateroom.</p>

<p>"Kenworth, it is useless to resist. Be sensible
and give yourself up. You are bound to be taken,
and to try to stave it off makes it all the worse."</p>

<p>Bang! Another bullet was the only answer
vouchsafed. The missile fanned Herc's ear and
buried itself in the moulding of the saloon wall.</p>

<p>"I'll stand no more nonsense!" cried Ned
sternly. "Are you going to surrender?"</p>

<p>"Never. I'll die before I'll rot in a federal
prison," cried Kenworth wildly.</p>

<p>Ned turned to Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've got to force the door," he said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"But, Ned, the man is half insane. Why not
shoot him down from outside here?"</p>

<p>"As if I'd do a thing like that! Come on!"</p>

<p>Right then the Jackies standing behind the
two young officers beheld an exhibition of pure
nerve that they had never seen excelled. Ned
raised his revolver and fired through the top of
the stateroom door where his bullet would be
certain to hurt no one. As he expected, it drew
Kenworth's fire.</p>

<p>Bang-Bang-Bang! came three shots. Ned
knew that the cylinder of the crazed midshipman's
revolver must be empty.</p>

<p>"Now!" he shouted. "Stand by, men!"</p>

<p>Rip-p-p-p! Cr-ash-h-h-h! The door was carried
clean off its hinges as Ned and Herc rushed
it. As it fell, the interior of the stateroom, reeking
with blue powder smoke, was revealed. Huddled
on the bunk in postures of abject terror were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Saki and the spectacled Jap who had caused Herc
so much trouble.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/04large.jpg"><img src="images/04.jpg" width="400" height="536" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">Rip-p-p-p! Cr-ash-h-h-h! The door was carried off its
hinges as Ned and Herc rushed in.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_296">Page 296</a></i></div>
</div>

<p>In the center of the room stood Kenworth.
His eyes blazed with a wild fire and he flourished
an empty revolver, while he yelled incoherently.</p>

<p>At the sight of Ned and Herc, the half insane
man uttered a piercing cry.</p>

<p>"I thought you were both dead!" he cried.
"But you have risen from the grave to confront
me!"</p>

<p>He slipped another cartridge into his revolver,
and Ned leaped forward just in time to dash the
weapon from the wretched renegade's hand. He
had turned the pistol on himself.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, Kenworth, by that time
a raging maniac, had been secured, and the two
Japs in sullen silence had been escorted with the
renegade midshipman on board the <i>Henry</i>. A
search of the <i>Halcyon</i> revealed several men
among the crew whom Herc recalled having seen
in the plotters' headquarters at Civic Island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Many papers and documents which there was not
time to examine just then were also recovered.</p>

<p>Ned placed three men in charge of the <i>Halcyon</i>
with orders to make her captain follow him into
New York harbor. Then he wirelessed news of
his success to the <i>Manhattan</i> and received a
warm reply of congratulation that made his blood
glow and his eyes shine. Herc, too, came in for
a share of commendation. With the congratulations,
came orders to proceed to the Brooklyn
Navy Yard and see that Kenworth was placed
in a hospital, for he was no longer responsible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was two days later. The Dreadnought Boys
stood facing the Secretary of the Navy in the
office of the commander of the Brooklyn Navy
Yard. What was to come, they did not know.
They had not yet been relieved of their command
of the <i>Henry</i>, and they feared that the
summons to present themselves to the Secretary
was for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the Secretary, looking
approvingly at the two spruce, smart, young officers,
"I suppose that you have no wish to take
off those uniforms?"</p>

<p>"Naturally not, sir," returned Ned, for Herc
was too embarrassed to speak. "It is the finest
uniform in the world and no one would willingly
doff it."</p>

<p>"Just what I think, Strong," said the Secretary,
"and I'm going to see to it that you do not
change these uniforms except for those of a
higher rank in the service."</p>

<p>Ned's eyes grew dim. The room swam before
him. He could hardly believe his ears. But the
Secretary continued,</p>

<p>"As I said the other day, both you young men
have shown ability of no common order, native
qualities that cannot be inducted by Naval Academies
or colleges. I have therefore made arrangements
to have your present appointments
made permanent, and you will, hereafter, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
special act, assume them with their rank, pay
and dignity until you are ready for the next
step upward; and I promise you that I shall keep
my eye upon you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Secretary, I&mdash;we&mdash;that is&mdash;we don't
know what to say, except to thank you and assure
you that it is the proudest moment of our lives,"
stammered Ned hoarsely in a voice that sounded
to him faint and far away. As for Herc, he
stood like one stunned, his freckles coming and
going on his alternately ruddy and pale cheeks
like pictures in a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>To relieve the situation, the Secretary changed
the subject.</p>

<p>"After the maneuvers, you will be granted a
furlough of one month. For the present, you
will retain command of the <i>Henry</i> and will rejoin
the Red fleet with all speed. By the way,
I may tell you that Kenworth can never recover
his reason. His mind is a total wreck. I suppose
it is charitable to attribute his treachery to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
his weakened intellect. As for the Japanese
spies, the government can only quietly see to it
that they are escorted out of the country never to
return. I understand that in Japan the life of a
detected spy is not a happy one, so that they will
meet their punishment even if the government of
this country cannot inflict a penalty upon them.
Against Rankin, of whose actions on the <i>Seneca</i>
we know, we have proved nothing; but he will be
watched."</p>

<p>And here, with the glory of their new honors
upon them, we must say "Good-by" once more
to the Dreadnought Boys. The events just
chronicled are so recent that it may be some time
before we can set down their further adventures.
The lads have been accepted most cordially by
their brother officers and are loved and respected
by their men.</p>

<p>Success has not turned their heads and as officers
they are proving the same modest, self-respecting
lads as ever. The Secretary and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
immediate superiors are keeping their eyes on the
two young officers, and ere long they will doubtless
have further chances to distinguish themselves.</p>

<p>But whether they are assigned to routine duty
or to exciting, adventurous cruises, the Dreadnought
Boys will always devote themselves, heart
and soul, to the defence of one standard&mdash;the
Flag of their country.</p>

<p><b>BEN STONE AT OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p>Under peculiarly trying circumstances
Ben Stone wins his way at
Oakdale Academy, and at the
same time enlists our sympathy,
interest and respect. Through the
enmity of Bern Hayden, the loyalty
of Roger Eliot and the clever work
of the "Sleuth," Ben is falsely accused,
championed and vindicated.</p>


<p><b>BOYS OF OAKDALE ACADEMY.</b></p>

<p>"One thing I will claim, and that
is that all Grants fight open and
square and there never was a sneak among them." It was
Rodney Grant, of Texas, who made the claim to his friend,
Ben Stone, and this story shows how he proved the truth
of this statement in the face of apparent evidence to the
contrary.</p>


<p><b>RIVAL PITCHERS OF OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p>Baseball is the main theme of this interesting narrative,
and that means not only clear and clever descriptions of
thrilling games, but an intimate acquaintance with the
members of the teams who played them. The Oakdale
Boys were ambitious and loyal, and some were even disgruntled
and jealous, but earnest, persistent work won out.</p>


<p><b>OAKDALE BOYS IN CAMP.</b></p>

<p>The typical vacation is the one that means much freedom,
little restriction, and immediate contact with "all outdoors."
These conditions prevailed in the summer camp of
the Oakdale Boys and made it a scene of lively interest.</p>


<p><b>THE GREAT OAKDALE MYSTERY.</b></p>

<p>The "Sleuth" scents a mystery! He "follows his nose."
The plot thickens! He makes deductions. There are
surprises for the reader&mdash;and for the "Sleuth," as well.</p>


<p><b>NEW BOYS AT OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p>A new element creeps into Oakdale with another year's
registration of students. The old and the new standards
of conduct in and out of school meet, battle, and cause
sweeping changes in the lives of several of the boys.</p>

<p><b>THE BOY INVENTORS' WIRELESS TELEGRAPH.</b></p>

<p>Blest with natural curiosity,&mdash;sometimes
called the instinct of investigation,&mdash;favored
with golden
opportunity, and gifted with creative
ability, the Boy Inventors
meet emergencies and contrive
mechanical wonders that interest
and convince the reader because
they always "work" when put to
the test.</p>


<p><b>THE BOY INVENTORS' VANISHING GUN.</b></p>

<p>A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement,
hope, effort and final success&mdash;this is the history of many
an invention; a history in which excitement, competition,
danger, despair and persistence figure. This merely suggests
the circumstances which draw the daring Boy Inventors
into strange experiences and startling adventures,
and which demonstrate the practical use of their vanishing
gun.</p>


<p><b>THE BOY INVENTORS' DIVING TORPEDO BOAT.</b></p>

<p>As in the previous stories of the Boy Inventors, new
and interesting triumphs of mechanism are produced
which become immediately valuable, and the stage for
their proving and testing is again the water. On the
surface and below it, the boys have jolly, contagious fun,
and the story of their serious, purposeful inventions
challenge the reader's deepest attention.</p>

<p><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS.</b></p>

<p>How the Bungalow Boys received
their title and how they retained the
right to it in spite of much opposition
makes a lively narrative for lively boys.</p>


<p><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS MAROONED
IN THE TROPICS.</b></p>

<p>A real treasure hunt of the most
thrilling kind, with a sunken Spanish
galleon as its object, makes a
subject of intense interest at any
time, but add to that a band of desperate men, a dark plot
and a devil fish, and you have the combination that brings
strange adventures into the lives of the Bungalow Boys.</p>


<p><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS IN THE GREAT NORTH
WEST.</b></p>

<p>The clever assistance of a young detective saves the boys
from the clutches of Chinese smugglers, of whose nefarious
trade they know too much. How the Professor's invention relieves
a critical situation is also an exciting incident of this book.</p>


<p><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS ON THE GREAT LAKES.</b></p>

<p>The Bungalow Boys start out for a quiet cruise on the
Great Lakes and a visit to an island. A storm and a band
of wreckers interfere with the serenity of their trip, and a
submarine adds zest and adventure to it.</p>

ON THE TRAIL.</b></p>

<p>What it meant to make an enemy

the problem that Jack Merrill and
his friends, including Coyote Pete,
face in this exciting tale.</p>


<p><b>THE BORDER BOYS
ACROSS THE FRONTIER.</b></p>

<p>Read of the Haunted Mesa and its
mysteries, of the Subterranean River
and its strange uses, of the value of
gasolene and steam "in running the gauntlet," and you will
feel that not even the ancient splendors of the Old World
can furnish a better setting for romantic action than the
Border of the New.</p>


<p><b>THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE MEXICAN

<p>As every day is making history&mdash;faster, it is said, than

are full of rapid action and accurate facts. This book
deals with lively times on the Mexican border.</p>


<p><b>THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE TEXAS
RANGERS.</b></p>

<p>The Border Boys have already had much excitement
and adventure in their lives, but all this has served to
prepare them for the experiences related in this volume.
They are stronger, braver and more resourceful than ever,
and the exigencies of their life in connection with the
Texas Rangers demand all their trained ability.</p>

<p><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS'
LOST MINE.</b></p>

<p>This is an absorbing story of the
continuous adventures of a motor
car in the hands of Nat Trevor and
his friends. It does seemingly impossible
"stunts," and yet everything
happens "in the nick of time."</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS
THROUGH THE SIERRAS.</b></p>

<p>Enemies in ambush, the peril of
fire, and the guarding of treasure
make exciting times for the Motor
Rangers&mdash;yet there is a strong flavor of fun and freedom,
with a typical Western mountaineer for spice.</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS ON BLUE WATER; or,
The Secret of the Derelict.</b></p>

<p>The strange adventures of the sturdy craft "Nomad" and
the stranger experiences of the Rangers themselves with
Morello's schooner and a mysterious derelict form the basis
of this well-spun yarn of the sea.</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS' CLOUD CRUISER.</b></p>

<p>From the "Nomad" to the "Discoverer," from the sea to
the sky, the scene changes in which the Motor Rangers figure.
They have experiences "that never were on land or sea,"
in heat and cold and storm, over mountain peak and lost
city, with savages and reptiles; their ship of the air is attacked
by huge birds of the air; they survive explosion and
earthquake; they even live to tell the tale!</p>

<p><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS
ON BATTLE PRACTICE.</b></p>

<p>Especially interesting and timely
is this book which introduces the
reader with its heroes, Ned and Herc,
to the great ships of modern warfare
and to the intimate life and surprising
adventures of Uncle Sam's sailors.</p>


<p><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS
ABOARD A DESTROYER.</b></p>

<p>In this story real dangers threaten
and the boys' patriotism is tested in
a peculiar international tangle. The scene is laid on the
South American coast.</p>


<p><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON A SUBMARINE.</b></p>

<p>To the inventive genius&mdash;trade-school boy or mechanic&mdash;this
story has special charm, perhaps, but to every reader its
mystery and clever action are fascinating.</p>


<p><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON AERO SERVICE.</b></p>

<p>Among the volunteers accepted for Aero Service are Ned
and Herc. Their perilous adventures are not confined to the
air, however, although they make daring and notable flights
in the name of the Government; nor are they always able
to fly beyond the reach of their old "enemies," who are also
airmen.</p>

<p>How Frank's summer experience

subject of this splendid story.</p>

<p>We find among the jolly boys
at Queen's School, Frank, the student-athlete, Jimmy, the
baseball enthusiast, and Lewis, the unconsciously-funny
youth who furnishes comedy for every page that bears
his name. Fall and winter sports between intensely rival
school teams are expertly described.</p>


<p><b>FRANK ARMSTRONG'S SECOND TERM.</b></p>

<p>The gymnasium, the track and the field make the background
for the stirring events of this volume, in which
David, Jimmy, Lewis, the "Wee One" and the "Codfish"
figure, while Frank "saves the day."</p>


<p><b>FRANK ARMSTRONG, DROP KICKER</b></p>

<p>With the same persistent determination that won him
success in swimming, running and baseball playing, Frank
Armstrong acquired the art of "drop kicking," and the
Queen's football team profits thereby.</p>

<p><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS AND
THE PHANTOM AIRSHIP.</b></p>

<p>Roy Prescott was fortunate in
having a sister so clever and devoted
to him and his interests that
they could share work and play
with mutual pleasure and to mutual
advantage. This proved especially
true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their aeroplane,
and Peggy won well deserved
fame for her skill and good
sense as an aviator. There were
many stumbling-blocks in their terrestrial path, but they
soared above them all to ultimate success.</p>


<p><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.</b></p>

<p>That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that
wins and holds girl enthusiasts as well as boys is proved
by this tale. On golden wings the girl aviators rose for
many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.</p>


<p><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS' SKY CRUISE.</b></p>

<p>To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure.
How much more perilous an adventure a "sky
cruise" might be is suggested by the title and proved by
the story itself.</p>


<p><b>THE GIRL AVIATORS' MOTOR BUTTERFLY.</b></p>

<p>The delicacy of flight suggested by the word "butterfly,"
the mechanical power implied by "motor," the ability to
control assured in the title "aviator," all combined with
the personality and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make
this story one for any girl or other reader "to go crazy
over."</p>

<p><b>MOLLY BROWN'S
FRESHMAN DAYS.</b></p>

<p>Would you like to admit to your
circle of friends the most charming
of college girls&mdash;the typical college
girl for whom we are always looking
but not always finding; the type
that contains so many delightful
characteristics, yet without unpleasant
perfection in any; the
natural, unaffected, sweet-tempered
girl, loved because she is lovable?
Then seek an introduction to Molly
Brown. You will find the baggage-master, the cook, the
Professor of English Literature, and the College President
in the same company.</p>


<p><b>MOLLY BROWN'S SOPHOMORE DAYS.</b></p>

<p>What is more delightful than a re-union of college girls
after the summer vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience&mdash;at least, if all class-mates
are as happy together as the Wellington girls of this
story. Among Molly's interesting friends of the second
year is a young Japanese girl, who ingratiates her "humbly"
self into everybody's affections speedily and permanently.</p>


<p><b>MOLLY BROWN'S JUNIOR DAYS.</b></p>

<p>Financial stumbling blocks are not the only things that
hinder the ease and increase the strength of college girls.
Their troubles and their triumphs are their own, often
peculiar to their environment. How Wellington students
meet the experiences outside the class-rooms is worth the
doing, the telling and the reading.</p>

<p><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS'
SCHOOL DAYS.</b></p>

<p>Billie Campbell was just the type
of a straightforward, athletic girl
to be successful as a practical
Motor Maid. She took her car, as
she did her class-mates, to her
heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together. The
road over which she ran her
red machine had many an unexpected
turning,&mdash;now it led her
into peculiar danger; now into contact
with strange travelers; and again into experiences
by fire and water. But, best of all, "The Comet" never
failed its brave girl owner.</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.</b></p>

<p>Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times,
for these were companionable girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full of unique adventures&mdash;and
so, of course, they found them.</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</b></p>

<p>It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully
entertaining to see old scenes through fresh eyes. It is
that privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join
the Motor Maids in their first 'cross-country run.</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND
HEATHER.</b></p>

<p>South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor
could their education by travel have been more wisely
begun. But now a speaking acquaintance with their own
country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to
the British Isles. How they made their polite American
bow and how they were received on the other side is a
tale of interest and inspiration.</p>

<p><b>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS
AROUND THE WORLD.</b></p>

<p>Could Jules Verne have dreamed
of encircling the globe with a motor
cycle for emergencies he would have
deemed it an achievement greater
than any he describes in his account
of the amusing travels of Philias
Fogg. This, however, is the purpose
successfully carried out by the Motor
Cycle Chums, and the tale of their
mishaps, hindrances and delays is
one of intense interest, secret amusement,
and incidental information to
the reader.</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS OF THE
NORTHWEST PATROL.</b></p>

<p>The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities
and in it the Motor Cycle Chums meet adventures even
more unusual and exciting than many of their experiences
on their tour around the world. There is not a dull page
in this lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant
"Chinee."</p>


<p><b>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS IN THE
GOLD FIELDS.</b></p>

<p>The gold fever which ran its rapid course through the
veins of the historic "forty-niners" recurs at certain intervals,
and seizes its victims with almost irresistible
power. The search for gold is so fascinating to the
seekers that hardship, danger and failure are obstacles
that scarcely dampen their ardour. How the Motor Cycle
Chums were caught by the lure of the gold and into what
difficulties and novel experiences they were led, makes a
tale of thrilling interest.</p>

<h3>The Boy Scouts on the Range.</h3>

<p>Connected with the dwellings of the vanished
race of cliff-dwellers was a mystery. Who
so fit to solve it as a band of adventurous Boy
Scouts? The solving of the secret and the routing
of a bold band of cattle thieves involved Rob
Blake and his chums, including "Tubby" Hopkins,
in grave difficulties.</p>

<p>There are few boys who have not read of
the weird snake dance and other tribal rites of
Moquis. In this volume, the habits of these fast
vanishing Indians are explained in interesting
detail. Few boys' books hold more thrilling
chapters than those concerning Rob's captivity
among the Moquis.</p>

<p>Through the fascinating pages of the narrative
also stalks, like a grim figure of impending
tragedy, the shaggy form of Silver Tip, the giant
grizzly. In modern juvenile writing, there is
little to be found as gripping as the scene in
which Rob and Silver Tip meet face to face.
The boy is weaponless and,&mdash;but it would not
be fair to divulge the termination of the battle.
A book which all Boy Scouts should secure and
place upon their shelves to be read and re-read.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
